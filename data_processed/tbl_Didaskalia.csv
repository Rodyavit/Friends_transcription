Julie not having sex?

we do plenty of other stuff, lot's of other stuff, like uhh. . .
RACHEL: No, no no no, don't need to know the details.

and she turned out to be a lesbian. So now I've got myself all psyched out, you know, and
it's become, like this, this thing and I. . . Well, you just must think I'm weird.
RACHEL: No, no, no, no I don't think it's weird, I think, I think umm, in fact, in fact
you know what I think?
ROSS: What?
RACHEL: I think it's sexy.
ROSS: Sexy?
RACHEL: Let me tell you something. As a woman there is nothing sexier than a man who does
not want to have sex.
ROSS: No kidding?
RACHEL: Oh yeah. In fact you know what I'd do?
ROSS: What?
RACHEL: I'd wait.
ROSS: You'd wait?
RACHEL: Yes, absolutely. I would wait and wait. . . then I'd wait some more.
ROSS: Really?
RACHEL: Oh yeah, I don't care how much she tells you she wants it, I don't care if begs,
she pleads, she tells you she, she's gonna have sex with, with another man. That just
means it's working.
ROSS: Women really want this?
RACHEL: More than jewelry. [Rachel struts off, extremely pleased with herself]
[Scene: Madison Square Garden. Duncan's dressing room.]
PHOEBE: Hi.
DUNCAN: Phoebe!
PHOEBE: Ta-da.
DUNCAN: Hey.
PHOEBE: Hi.
DUNCAN: Ahh, look at you, you look great.
PHOEBE: Do I? Thank you, so do you.
DUNCAN: Thanks.
PHOEBE: Sparkly. So, wow, this is pretty wonerful, huh. Mr. major capades guy. I, I
remember when you were just, like, King Friday in Mr. Roger's Ice is Nice.
DUNCAN: You always said I'd make it.
PHOEBE: Yeah, well, ya know, I'm kind of spooky that way. Wooo.
DUNCAN: I missed you. [they hug] I'm gonna get changed.
PHOEBE: OK.
DUNCAN: Um, now. Phoebs.
PHOEBE: Oh, right, OK. Ole.
DUNCAN: What?
PHOEBE: Um, the matador. [Duncan leaves] Ole, ha ha ha.
[Scene: Ross's apartment. Ross and Julie are setting the table.]
ROSS: Julie, can you hold this for a second, thanks. [hands her a bowl and kisses her]
[Chandler, Monica, Joey, and Rachel enter. Ross and Julie don't notice.]
CHANDLER: Uh, Julie.
JULIE: Yeah?
CHANDLER: Sorry, you had a paleontologist on your face. But, uh, it's gone now, you're
alright.
ROSS: Hi everyone.
ALL: Hi.
ROSS: [pulls Rachel aside] I just, I wanted to thank you for our uh, our little talk
before.
RACHEL: Oh, God, no problem. So you're gonna go with the uh, waiting thing?
ROSS: Well, I was going to, but after I talked to you, I talked to Joey.
RACHEL: What did, what did he say?
ROSS: Basically he told me to get over myself and just do it, ya know. So I though about
what you said and I though about what he said and, well, his way I get to have sex tonight
so. . .
[Scene: Ross's apartment. After dinner. Chandler enters.]
CHANDLER: What's this in my pocket? Why it's Joey's porno movie.
ROSS: Pop it in.
JOEY: I'm fine with it, I mean, if you're OK watching a video filled with two nippled
people. [Chandler puts the tape in]
RACHEL: Great, people having sex, that's just what I need to see.
ROSS: What's wrong with people having sex?
RACHEL: Well, well um, you know, these movies are offensive and uh, degrading to women and
females. And uh, and the lighting's always unflattering. And, Monica help me out here.
MONICA: Hell, I wanna see Joey.
[video starts with the cheesy porn disco music]
JULIE: So is there like a story or do they just stard doing it right. . . oh, never mind.
CHANDLER: OK, now wait a minute. That is the craziest typing test I've ever seen.
MONICA: All I say is, she better get the job.
ROSS: Looks to me like he's the one getting the job.
JOEY: Shh, OK, here I come, here I come. See I'm comin' to fix the copier, I can't get to
the copier, I'm thinkin' what do I do, what do I do. . . so I just watch 'em have sex. And
then I say, wait, here's my line, [Joey from TV] you know that's bad fo r the paper
tray.
CHANDLER: Nice work my friend.
JOEY: Thank you. Wait wait wait wait, you see me again. Hang on, the guy's butt's blockin'
me. There I am, there I am, there I am, there I am, there I am. . .
[Scene: Madison Square Garden, Duncan's dressing room. Phoebe is fixing her hair and
Duncan enters.]
PHOEBE: So um, so what's up, you came to see me yesterday.
DUNCAN: Oh, yeah, um, alright, I kinda need a divorce.
PHOEBE: Ohh. . .K. How come?
DUNCAN: Umm, actually, I'm getting married again.
PHOEBE: What?
DUNCAN: Oh God, I don't know how to tell you this. I'm straight.
PHOEBE: Huuh.
DUNCAN: Yeah, I know, I.
PHOEBE: I, I don't, I don't understand, how can you be straight? I mean, you're, you're so
smart and funny and you throw such great Academy Award parties.
DUNCAN: I know, that's what I kept telling myself but you just reach a point where you
can't live a lie anymore.
PHOEBE: So how long have you known?
DUNCAN: Well I guess on some level I always knew I was straight. I though I was supposed
to be something else, you know, I'm an ice dancer, all my friends are gay, I was just
tryin' to fit in.
PHOEBE: And um, and there's actually a, a woman?
DUNCAN: Her name's Debra.
PHOEBE: Oh. Well is she, is she the first that you've been with?
DUNCAN: Well, I've never told you this but, there were one or two times, back in college,
when I'd get really drunk, go to a straight bar and wake up with a woman next to me. But
I, I, I told myself it was the liquor and e-everyone experiments in college. 
PHOEBE: Sure.
DUNCAN: But now I know I don't have a choice about this, I was born this way.
PHOEBE: I, I don't know what to say. I mean, you know, you're married to someone for six
years and you think you know him and then one day says, 'Oh, I'm not gay.'
DUNCAN: I'm, I'm still me.
PHOEBE: Why couldn't you have just figured this out six years ago?
[Scene: Ross's apartment. Everyone is sitting around. Monica enters from bathroom.]
MONICA: You know, it still smells like monkey in there.
JULIE: That saves us a conversation.
CHANDLER: Well, listen, this has been great but I'm officially wiped.
JOEY: Me too, we should get goin'.
RACHEL: No, no, I mean, no, c'mon you guys, I mean, c'mon look it's only eleven thirty.
Let's just talk, we never just hang out and talk anymore.
MONICA: Rachel, that's all we do.
RACHEL: Maybe that's all we do, what about Julie?
JULIE: What about Julie?
RACHEL: Well, you have been in our lives for nearly two months now and we don't really
know you. I mean, who is Julie? I mean, what do you like, what don't you like? We wanna
hear everything.
JULIE: Well, that could take a while.
RACHEL: So. I mean, who here does not have the time to get to know Julie?
CHANDLER: I got the time to get to know Julie.
JOEY: I got time.
MONICA: Rach, I know her pretty well, can I go? [Rachel gives her a look from hell] That's
fine.
RACHEL: OK Julie, so now let's start with your childhood, what was that like?
JULIE: Well, in a nutshell. . .
RACHEL: Nah, uh, uh, uh, uh.
[Scene: Madison Square Garden, Duncan's dressing room. Phoebe is signing the divorce
papers.]
PHOEBE: So, um, have you told your parents?
DUNCAN: No, but it'll be OK, they're pretty cool, my brother's straight so. . .
PHOEBE: [handing him the papers] Here you go. You know what, I just have one more
question, um, if you had figured this out sooner and um, I had been around, do you think
that I would have been the one who. . . no, um, I'm sorry, don't tell me, I don't th ink
either answer would make me feel better.
DUNCAN: I love you Phoebe. [they hug and kiss]
PHOEBE: So your brother's straigh huh? Seriously.
[Scene: Ross's apartment. Julie is telling her live story.]
JULIE: And my second grade teacher was Ms. Thomas, and my first grade teacher was Mrs.
Cobb.
RAHCEL: Mrs., Mrs. Gobb?
JULIE: No Cobb, as in cobb salad.
RACHEL: Now, what exactly is in a cobb salad?
CHANDLER: I'm goin' home.
RACHEL: What?
[Outside in the hallway, Chandler, Joey, and Monica exit]
JOEY: Boy that Julie's a talker, huh?
ROSS: Goodnight.
RACHEL: So, it's pretty late, you're probably uh, not still planning on. . .
ROSS: Oh, no no, I am.
RACHEL: Oh, well, are hey, are you nervous?
ROSS: Um, no, I uh, I have done it before.
RACHEL: Uh, OK, I mean uh, what, how are you gonna handle it. I mean, are, are ya gonna,
are ya gonna talk about it before hand, are you just gonna pounce?
ROSS: I uh, I don't know, I guess I'm just gonna see, see what happens.
RAHCEL: OK, gook luck.
ROSS: Wha, uhh, what?
RACHEL: Nothing, I mean, um, it is your first time with her and, you know if the first
time doesn't go well, well then that's, that's pretty darn hard to recover from.
ROSS: OK, now I'm nervous.
RACHEL: Maybe you should put it off.
ROSS: No, no, I don't wanna put it off, I just, God I just, I spent last year being so
unbelievably miserable, ya know, and now, now I'm actually happy. You know, I mean, really
happy. I just, I just don't wanna, I don't wanna mess it up, ya know.
RACHEL: I know, yeah, sorry.
ROSS: What, it's not your fault.
RACHEL: Maybe it, maybe it doesn't have to be this tough. I mean, maybe you were on the
right track with this whole, you know, spontaneous thing. I mean, women really like that.
ROSS: Really?
RACHEL: Yeah, I mean, you know it, I mean, if it were me I, I, you know, I'd want you to,
I don't know, like catch me off guard, you know, with like a really good kiss, you know
really, sort of um, soft at first, then maybe um brush the hair away from my face, and
look far into my eyes in a way that let's me know that something amazing is about to
happen.
ROSS: [being drawn in by her talk] Uh-huh.
RACHEL: And then, I don't know, I mean you'd pull me really close to you so that, so that
I'd be pressed up, you know, right against you. And, um, it would get kind of sweaty and
uh, and blurry, and then it's just happening.
ROSS: Ohh. . . Thanks Rach, goodnight. [goes back in apartment]
RACHEL: Ohh, God.CLOSING CREDITS

cry. Why is he still crying?
ROSS: Let me hold him for a sec. There. (Ben stops crying) Huh? There we are.
MONICA: Maye it's me.
ROSS: Don't be silly. Ben loves you. He's just being Mr. Crankypants.
CHANDLER: You know, I once dated a Miss Crankypants. Lovely girl, kinda moody.
ROSS: There we go. All better. (gives Ben back to Monica)
MONICA: There's my little boy. (Ben starts crying again)
CHANDLER: Can I uh see something? (Takes Ben. When he puts him close to Monica, Ben cries.

JOEY: Cool.
MONICA: He hates me. My nephew hates me.
ROSS: Come on, don't do this.
MONICA: What if my own baby hates me? Huh? What am I gonna do then?
CHANDLER: Monica, will you stop? This is nuts. Do you know how long it's gonna be before
you actually have to deal with this problem? I mean, you don't even have a boyfriend yet.
Joey, she does not look fat.
(Chandler has a basketball which he is moving closer to, then away from, Monica)
JOEY: Goo, goo, goo, waaah!
MONICA: That is so funny. Let me see that. (throws the ball out the window)
JOEY: Are you ok, Ross?
ROSS: I don't know. What's in this pie? 
MONICA: Uh, I don't know, butter, eggs, flour, lime, kiwi-- 
ROSS: Kiwi? Kiwi? I thought it was a key lime pie.
MONICA: No I didn't, I said kiwi lime. That's what makes it so special. 
ROSS: And that's what's gonna kill me. I'm allergic to kiwi.
MONICA: No you're not. You're, you're allergic to lobster and peanuts and--oh my god.
ROSS: Ugh.
MONICA: Oh my god.
ROSS: Ugh. It's definitely getting worse.
MONICA: Is your tongue swelling up?
ROSS: Either that or my mouth is getting smaller.
MONICA: All right, get your coat, we're going to the hospital.
JOEY: Is he gonna be ok?
MONICA: Yeah, he's just gotta get a shot.
ROSS: You know, you know, actually it's getting better. It is. It is. Let's not go. Anyone
for Thcrabble?
MONICA: Jacket now.
ROSS: What about Ben? We can't bring a baby to a hospital.
CHANDLER: We'll watch him.
ROSS: I don't think tho.

PHOEBE: Hey Rach, wanna hear the new song I'm thinkin' of singing this afternoon? I wrote
it this morning in the shower.
RACHEL: Ok.
PHOEBE: (singing) I'm in the shower and I'm writing a song. Stop me if you've heard it. My
skin is soapy, and my hair is wet, and Tegrin spelled backward is Nirget.
TERRY: Uh, Rachel, sweetheart, could I see ya for a minute?
RACHEL: What's up?
TERRY: F.Y.I.. I've decided to pay a professional musician to play in here on Sunday
afternoons. Her name is Stephanie... something. She's supposed to be very good.
RACHEL: But what about Phoebe?
TERRY: Rachel, it's not that your friend is bad, it's that she's so bad, she makes me want
to put my finger through my eye into my brain and swirl it around.
RACHEL: Ok, ok, so you're not a fan, but I mean, come on, you cannot do this to her.
TERRY: Uh--
RACHEL: Oh, no no no no. Oh no no no no. I have to do this to her?
PHOEBE: (singing) Lather, rinse, repeat, and lather, rinse, repeat, and lather, rinse,
repeat, as needed.(Chandler and Joey are loaded down with baby stuff, and Ben)
CHANDLER: You know, I don't think we brought enough stuff. Did you forget to pack the
baby's anvil?
JOEY: It's gonna be worth it. It's a known fact that women love babies, all righ? Women
love guys who love babies. It's that whole sensitive thing. Quick, aim him at that pack o'
babes over there. Maybe one of them will break away. No, no wait, for get them, we got
one, hard left. All right, gimme the baby.
CHANDLER: No, I got him.
JOEY: No, seriously.

JOEY: Oh, yeah. He's got that great baby smell. Get a whiff of his head.
CAROLINE: I think my uterus just skipped a beat.
JOEY: (to Chandler) What'd I tell you? What'd I tell you?
CAROLINE: I think it's great you guys are doing this.
CHANDLER: Well, we are great guys.
CAROLINE: You know, my brother and his boyfriend have been trying to adopt for three
years. What agency did you two go through?(Central Perk)
PHOEBE: But, but this is my gig. This is where I play. My, my name is written out there in
chalk. You know, you can't just erase chalk.
RACHEL: Honey, I'm sorry.
PHOEBE: And he's going to be paying this woman? Why doesn't he just give her like a
throne, and a crown, and like a, you know, gold stick with a ball on top.
RACHEL: Terry is a jerk, ok? That's why we're always saying ""Terry's a jerk!""
That's where that came from.
PHOEBE: Yeah, ok. You probably did everything you could. 
RACHEL: Ok, you know what, lemme, let me just see what else I can do. All right, look,
look. Why don't you just let her go on after Stephanie whatever-her-name-is. I mean, you
won't even be here. You don't pay her. It's not gonna cost you anything.
TERRY: I, I don't know. 
RACHEL: Come on, Terry, I'll even clean the cappuccino machine.
TERRY: You don't clean the cappuccino machine?
RACHEL: Of course I clean it. I mean, I,I will cleeeean it. I mean, I will cleeeean it.
TERRY: Oh, all right, fine, fine, fine.
RACHEL: Done.
PHOEBE: Really?
RACHEL: Yeah. Who's workin' for you babe?
PHOEBE: Oh! Oh my god. This is so exciting. How much am I gonna get?
RACHEL: What?
PHOEBE: Well you said that he's paying the people who are playing.
RACHEL: Oh, no, no no. I meant that he's gonna be paying that other woman beause she's a
professional.
PHOEBE: Well, I'm not gonna be the only one who's not getting paid.
RACHEL: Well, but Pheebs.
PHOEBE: No, huh uh, I'm sorry, no. No, I'm not some like sloppy second, charity band. You
know what, there are thousands of places in this city where people would be happy to pay
to hear me play. (Out on the sidewalk, singing) When I play, I play for me, I don't need
your charity. (Someone puts a coin in her guitar case) Thank you! La la la la la la la....
ROSS: Well, there's no way I'm gonna get a shot. Maybe they can take the needle and
thquirt it into my mouth, you know, like a thquirt gun. 
DOCTOR: Hello, there. I'm Dr. Carlin. I see someone's having an allergic reaction.
MONICA: Doctor, can I see you for just a minute please? My brother has a slight phobia
about needles.
ROSS: Did you tell him about my thquirt gun idea?
MONICA: My brother, the PhD would like to know if there's any way to treat this orally. 
DOCTOR: No, under these circumstances it has to be an injection, and it has to be now.
ROSS: Tho?
(Monica shakes her head.)
ROSS: Ohhh.
MONICA: That's good, have a seat. Um, the doctor says it's gotta be a needle. You're just
gonna have to be brave, ok? Can you do that for me?
ROSS: Ok.
MONICA: Ok. Oh boy. You are doin' so good. You wanna squeeze my hand? All right, Ross,
don't squeeze it so hard. Honey, really, don't squeeze it so hard! Oh, Ross! Let go of my
hand!
CHANDLER: That's a good plan, Joe. Next time we wanna pick up women, we should just go to
the park and make out. Taxi, taxi!
JOEY: Hey, hey, look at that talent.
CHANDLER: (to taxi driver) Just practicing. You're good. Carry on.
GIRL 1 ON BUS: Hey, you. He's just adorable.
CHANDLER: Ok, but can you tell him that, because he thinks he's too pink.
GIRL 2 ON BUS: So what are you guys out doing today?
JOEY: Oh we're not out. No, no. We're just uh, two heterosexual guys, hanging with the son
of our other heterosexual friend, doin' the usual straight guy stuff.
CHANDLER: You done?
JOEY: Yeah.
GIRL 1: Oh, there's our stop.
JOEY: Get outta here. This is our stop too.
GIRL 2: You guys live around here too?
JOEY: Oh, yeah, yeah, sure. We live in the building by the uh sidewalk.
CHANDLER: You know it?
JOEY: Hey, look, since we're neighbors and all, what do you say we uh, get together for a
drink?
GIRL 1: So uh, you wanna go to Marquel's?
CHANDLER: Oh, sure, they love us over there.
GIRL 2: Where's your baby?
CHANDLER AND JOEY: (running after bus) Ben! Ben! Ben! 
CHANDLER: Oh, that's good. Maybe he'll hear you and pull the cord.
BOTH: Stop the bus! Wait! Wait! Wait! 
MONICA: Are you sure he didn't break it because it really hurts.
DOCTOR: No, it's just a good bone bruise. And, right here is the puncture wound from your
ring.
ROSS: Oh, I'm sorry, I'm really sorry. Sorry. Sorry! Hey! Hey! I got my s's back! Which we
can celebrate later. Celebrate. 
PHOEBE: (singing) ... with the double double double-jointed boy. Hey. So um, are you the
professional guitar player?
STEPHANIE: Yeah. I'm Stephanie.
PHOEBE: Right. My name was on there, but now it just says ""carrot cake"". So, um,
so um, how many chords do you know?
STEPHANIE: All of them. 
PHOEBE: Oh yeah, so you know D?
STEPHANIE: Yeah.
PHOEBE: Ok, do you know A minor?
STEPHANIE: Yeah.
PHOEBE: Ok, do you know how to go from D to A minor?
STEPHANIE: Yeah.
PHOEBE: Ok. Um, so does your guitar have a strap?
STEPHANIE: No.
PHOEBE: Oh. Mine does. (singing) Stephanie knows all the chords. (makes a face)
CHANDLER: (on pay phone) Come on, pick up, pick up! Hello? Transit Authority? Yes, hello.
I'm doing research for a book, and I was wondering what someone might do if they left a
baby on a city bus. Yes I do realize that would be a very stupid charact er.
JOEY: Hi, here's the deal. We lost a carseat on a bus today. It's white plastic, with a
handle, and it fits onto a stroller. Oh, and there was a baby in it. He wants to talk to
you again.
RACHEL: Ok, everybody, let's give a uh nice warm Central Perk welcome to--
PHOEBE: (singing angrily) Terry's a jerk, and he won't let me work, and I hate Central
Perk!
RACHEL: Uh, to Stephanie Schiffer.
STEPHANIE: Thank you. I'd like to start with a song that I wrote for the first man I ever
loved. (singing) Zachary.
PHOEBE: (singing/screaming) You're all invited to bite me!
CHANDLER AND JOEY: Hi. We're the guys who called about the baby. We left the baby on ths
bus. Is he here? Is he here?
TRANSIT AUTHORITY GUY: He's here. (Chandler and Joey hug each other in relief) I'm
assuming one of you is the father.
CHANDLER: That's me.
JOEY: I'm him.
CHANDLER: Actually, uh, we're both the father. (Puts his arm around Joey)
BOTH (but to different babies): Oh, Ben! Hey, buddy!
CHANDLER: Please tell me you know which one is our baby.
JOEY: Well, well that one has ducks on his t-shirt, and this one has clowns. And Ben was
definitely wearing ducks.
CHANDLER: Ok.
JOEY: Or clowns. Oh, oh wait. That one's definitely Ben. Remember, he had that cute little
mole by his mouth.
CHANDLER: Yeah?
JOEY: Yeah.
CHANDLER: Hey, Ben, remember us? Ok, the mole came off.
JOEY: Ahh!
CHANDLER: What're we gonna do? What're we gonna do?
JOEY: Uh, uh, we'll flip for it. Ducks or clowns.
CHANDLER: Oh, we're gonna flip for the baby?
JOEY: You got a better idea? 
CHANDLER: All right, call it in the air.
JOEY: Heads.
CHANDLER: Heads it is.
JOEY: Yes! Whew!
CHANDLER: We have to assign heads to something.
JOEY: Right. Ok, ok, uh, ducks is heads, because ducks have heads.
CHANDLER: What kind of scary-ass clowns came to your birthday?(on the sidewalk outside Central Perk)
RACHEL: Hey.
PHOEBE: Oh, hi.
RACHEL: Here. I thought you might be cold.
PHOEBE: Thank you.
RACHEL: Whoa, look at you, you did pretty well.
PHOEBE: Eight dollars and 27 cents. But not really, 'cause I put in the first two, just
to, you know, get the ball rolling, and to make myself feel better.
RACHEL: Do you?
PHOEBE: No. This whole like playing-for-money thing is so not good for me. You know, I
don't know, when I sang ""Su-Su-Suicide"", I got a dollar seventy-five. But then,
""Smelly Cat"", I got 25 cents and a condom. So you know, now I just feel really
bad for Smelly Cat.
RACHEL: Well, you know, honey, I don't think everybody gets Smelly Cat. You know, I mean,
if all you've ever actually had are healthy pets, then, whoosh!
PHOEBE: It's not even that. I used to do my songs because it made me happy, but now it's
like, it's just all about the money.
RACHEL: Well, people missed you in there. And in fact, there was actually a request for
""Smelly Cat"".
PHOEBE: Really? From who?
RACHEL: Well, from me. And I know it's not your big money song, but it's my favorite.
KID: Hi. Uh, did I accidentally drop a condom in your case? It's kind of an emergency.
PHOEBE: Yeah. Here you go.
KID: Thanks a lot. Hey Christine, I got it!(chez Monica and Rachel)

PHOE: No, whad'ya mean? He's not British.
JOEY: Maybe he's. . . gay.
PHOE: Oohh, um, no, I don't think that's the problem. 'Cause we went, um, dancing the

just like... definitely felt something.

divorce so, if I seem a little nervous, I am.

MICH: [confused] I'm sorry?
RACH: Cats, how long do they live figuring you don't... y'know, throw 'em under a bus or
something?
MICH: Um, maybe 15, 16 years.

MICH: Um, cheers.
RACH: Oh, right, clink. [downs her glass]
MICH: Monica told you I was cuter that this, didn't she?
RACH: Oh, no, Michael, it's not you. I'm sorry, it's just, it's this thing. It's probably
not as bad as it sounds but this friend of mine is, is getting a cat with his girlfriend.
MICH: Oh, that does sound. . .Ahh.
RACH: I mean he just started going out with her.
MICH: Is this guy, uhh, an old boyfriend?

talk about you. 
MICH: Alright.
RACH: OK, OK. So, you ever get a pet with a girlfriend?
[Scene: Central Perk. Phoebe and Joey are sitting on the couch.]
PHOE: So, I figured it out.
JOEY: What?
PHOE: Why Scott doesn't want to sleep with me. It's 'cause I'm not sexy enough.
JOEY: Phoebe, that's crazy. When I first met you, you know what I said to Chandler? I
said, ""Excellent butt, great rack.""
PHOE: Really? That's so sweet. I mean, I'm officially offended but, sweet.
JOEY: Phoebs look, if you want to know what the deal is, you're just gonna have to ask
him.
PHOE: You're right, you're right. Ah, you are so yumm. [they hug]

glass.]

one of those bugs, y'know, one of those fruitflies, those things that live for like a day
or something? [belligerently] What're they called, what're they called, what're they
called?
MICH: Fruitflies?
RACH: Yes! Thank you.
[The waiter comes to the table.]
WAITER: So, would you like any dessert?
MICH: No! No dessert, just a check, please.
RACH: Oh, you're not having fun, are you?
MICH: No, no, I am, but only because for the last hour and a half I've been playing the
movie Diner in my head.
RACH: Oh, look at me, look at me. Oh, I'm on a date with a really great guy, all I can
think about is Ross and his cat and his... Julie. I just want to get over him. gosh, why
can't I do that?
MICH: Oy. Look, I've been through a divorce, trust me you're gonna be fine. You just can't
see it now because you haven't had any closure.
RACH: Yeah! Closure. That's what it is, that's what I need. God, you're brilliant! Why
didn't I think of that? How do I get that?
MICH: Well, you know, there's no one way really, it's just, you know, whatever it takes so
that you can finally say to him, ""I'm over you.""
RACH: Closure, that's what it is. Closure. [she looks around the restaurant, spotting a
guy with a cellular phone] Hello, excuse me. Excuse me, hel. . . woo [she almost falls out
of her chair]

myself. [man is still reluctant] OK, you're bein' a little weird about your phone.

[Rachel enters from her room]
RACHEL: Oh, gosh, it's hot in here.
MONICA: Rach, get the heat. [Rachel holds up her hand with wet fingernail polish] Ross,
could you turn the heat down please?
ROSS: Sure. By the way, there's a difference between being obsessive and. . .
MONICA: Ross, the heat!
ROSS: Fine, OK! Heat, heat, heat, and I'm the obsessive one. [goes to the radiator and
starts turning the knob] OK, this way is on, so this is. . . [breaks off the knob] off.
RACHEL: Did you just break the radiator?
ROSS: No, no, I was turnin' the knob and, and. . . here it is.
MONICA: Well put it back.
ROSS: It uhh, it won't go back.
RACHEL: I'll call the super.
MONICA: Here, let me try.
ROSS: Oh, oh that's right, I forgot about your ability to fuse metal.
MONICA: Hey, it's Funny's cousin, Not Funny.
RACHEL: [on phone] Hi, Mr. Treeger. Hi, it's Rachel Green from upstairs. Yes, somebody,
uh, broke our knob on the radiator and it's really hot in here. Yes, it's, it's hot enough
to bake cookies. Well, do you think we could have a new one by 6? Wha t, no, no, Tuesday,
we can't wait until Tuesday, we're having a party tonight.
ROSS: OK, tip the man.
MONICA: No, if he doesn't like our cookies, too bad, I am not gonna be blackmailed. Look
if worse comes to worse, it gets a little warm, we'll call it a theme party.
ROSS: Hey, here's a theme: Come on in, live like bacon.

stripped down because of the heat.]
RACHEL: [answers door] Hi, welcome to our tropical Christmas party. You can put your coats
and sweaters and pants and shirts in the bedroom.
ROSS: [sitting at table talking to a girl] It's hard to tell because I'm sweating, but I
use exactly what the gel bottle says, an amount about the size of a pea. How, how can that
be too much?
MONICA: [carrying an ice cube tray] Ice, ice, ice squares anyone? Take a napkin. Alright.
ROSS: Monica, Monica, your guest are turning into jerky, OK.
MONICA: Really? I'm perfectly comfortable. [one of the guest opens the refrigerator] Hey,
hey, hey, get in line buddy, I was next. [she opens the refrigerator and leans into it]
RACHEL: [answering the door] Mr. Treeger.
MR. TREEGER: Uhh, you said there was a party.
RACHEL: Oh, yeah, well hey, welcome to our sauna.
MR. TREEGER: Ahh, is it hot? My body always stays cool, probably 'cause I have so much
skin. Hey, cheese!

little pouty chin.

Malibu Barbi that will no longer be wearing white to her wedding.

you.' Gosh. 'Your not-so-secretive admirer, Erica Ford.' Ooh wait, 'PS enclosed please
find 14 of my eyelashes.'

ROSS: Hey guys.

ROSS: Well, I uh, I can't seem to find the monkey I donated last year. He's a capuchan,
answers to the name Marcel.
LIPSON: Ahh, I'm afraid I have some bad news. Marcel has passed on.
ROSS: Oh my God, what happened?
LIPSON: Well he got sick, and then he got sicker, and then he got a little better but then
he died.
ROSS: I can't believe this.
LIPSON: I'm sorry Mr. Geller. But ya know, there's an old saying, 'Sometimes monkeys die.'
It's not a great saying but it certainly is fitting today.
ROSS: Well, ya know, someone should have called me.
LIPSON: I'm sorry. Look, I know this can't bring him back but here, it's just a gesture.
ROSS: Zoo dollars?
LIPSON: Yes, and come see the bird show at 4. The macaws wear hats. Well it's a lot cuter

Drake Remore.

magical box in her living room doesn't mean she's not a person. I mean, does she not
deserve happiness, does she not deserve love? What're you lookin' at me for? He's the one
who wants to boff the maniac.

PHOEBE: No, uh-uh, I'm just, I'm nervous. So, you know what, maybe if I just, if I picture
them all in their underwear.
ROB: That's not a good idea, that's kinda the reason the last guy got fired.
PHOEBE: I'm just, I'm, I'm, I'm used to playing for grown-ups. Ya know, they just,
grown-ups drink their coffee and do their grown-up thing, ya know, and kids listen. This
is a huge responsibility. What? Are you gonna kiss me?

PHOEBE: OK. [they kiss] OK, alrighty, let's play some tunes. Hi everybody, I'm Phoebe

JOEY: Yeah it is. . . what?
ERICA: Well, here we sit, devil may care, just a little while ago you were reattaching
someone's spinal cord.
JOEY: Yeah, that was a tricky one. In reality, that operation takes like, over 10 hours,
but they only showed it for 2 minites.
ERICA: Who's they?
JOEY: No one.
ERICA: Oh Drake, you are so talented, let me see those hands. Oh these hands, these
beautiful hands, oh I could just eat them. . . but I won't.
JOEY: Good, otherwise my watch would fall off. [laughs hysterically]
ERICA: No, seriously. These hands. These miracle, magical, life-giving hands. Oh, just to
be near them, touch them, maybe even lick one?

that.

zoo dollars?

JOEY: Uhh, cause, uhh, I'm a neurosurgeon and that was clearly a case of, uh, uh, foodal
chokage. Alright, look, I got to tell you something.
ERICA: No, no no no, you don't have to tell me anything. You don't have to explain
yourself to me. Ooh, who am I to question the great Dr. Drake Remore?

PHOEBE: Thank you for coming everybody. There're cookies in the back.
ROB: That was great, the kids loved you.
PHOEBE: Yay, I rock.
ROB: And you know why? Because you told the truth, and nobody ever tells kids the
truth.You were incredible.
PHOEBE: But.
ROB: How did you know there was a but?
PHOEBE: I sense these things. It was either but or butter.
ROB: The thing is, I think some of the parents, they were kinda hopin' that you'd play
more songs about like, barnyard animals.
PHOEBE: I can do that.
ROB: Really?
PHOEBE: Yeah.
ROB: Because that would be fantastic. What? You wanna kiss me?
PHOEBE: Thinkin' about it.[Scene: San Diego Zoo. Ross and the janitor are in the nocturnal house.]
JANITOR: Ahh, the bat. Ambassador of darkness, flitting out of his cave like a winged
messenger, sightless spectre of the macabe.
ROSS: Buddy, my monkey?
JANITOR: Oh, yeah, right. There was a break-in, few months back, inside job. Your monkey
was taken.
ROSS: Oh my God. But the zoo told me that my monkey was dead.
JANITOR: The zoo! Do you believe everything the zoo tells ya?
ROSS: That, that's the only thing the zoo's ever told me.
JANITOR: Of course they're gonna say he's dead. They don't want the bad publicity. It's
all a great big cover-up. Do you have any idea how high up this thing goes?
ROSS: That guy Lipson?
JANITOR: Lipson knows. Do you have any idea who else knows?
ROSS: No, I, I only know Lipson.
JANITOR: Hmm, Lipson knows huh? Ahh, hello Mr. Opossum, enigma of the trees, upside-down
denizen of the night, taunting gravity with...
ROSS: Buddy, my monkey, my monkey.
JANITOR: Word on the street - well, when I say street, I mean those little pretend streets
they have here at the zoo.
ROSS: Of course.
JANITOR: Your monkey found a new career, in the entertainment field. That's all I know.
ROSS: This is unbelievable.
JANITOR: So, what is this information worth to you, my friend?
ROSS: Are you trying to get me to bribe you?
JANITOR: Maybe.
ROSS: But you already told me everything.[Scene: Library. Ross show up with a MonkeyShine Beer poster.]
ROSS: Check it out, he actually is the MonkeyShine monkey.
RACHEL: Well, so what're you gonna do?
ROSS: Well, I guess I'm gonna call the beer company and try to find out where he is.

JOEY: Alright look, that's it. I don't think we should see each other anymore, alright.
Look, I know I should have told you this a long time ago but I am not Drake Remore, OK.
I'm not even a doctor, I'm an actor. I just pretend to be a doctor.

JOEY: Somebody wanna help me out here?
RACHEL: Oh, I know, I know. [Turns on the TV. Joey in on it.]
ERICA: How, how can you be here and there.
JOEY: 'Cause it's a television show.
ERICA: Drake, what're you getting at?
JOEY: I'm not Drake.
ROSS: That's right, he's not Drake, he's Hans Remore, Drake's evil twin.
ERICA: Is this true?
RACHEL: Yes, yes it is true. And I know this because, because he pretended to be Drake to,
to sleep with me. [throws water in his face]
MONICA: And then he told me he would run away with me, and he didn't. [throws water in his
face]
CHANDLER: And you left the toilet seat up, you bastard. [throws water in his face]
ERICA: Is all this true?
JOEY: Yes, I'm afraid it is. You deserve much better than me Erica. You deserve to be with
the real Drake, he's the one you fell in love with. Go to Salem, find him, he's the guy
for you.

ROB: No.
PHOEBE: I see.
ROB: Maybe if you just played some regular kiddie songs.
PHOEBE: No. What do you, what do you want me to be, like some stupid, big, like, purple
dinosaur?

PHOEBE: Who's Barney.[Scene: Central Perk. The whole gang is there.]

SECURITY GUARD: C'mon people, back up please, back up, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon.
ROSS: Uh, excuse me, uh, where can we find the monkey?
SECURITY GUARD: I'm sorry guys, closed set.
ROSS: Uh, I'm sorry, you don't understand, I'm, I'm, I'm a friend of his. We uh, we used
to live together.
SECURITY GUARD: Yeah, and I have a time share in the Pocanos with Flipper.
MONICA: Ross, there he is.
ROSS: Hey, hey buddy, Marcel. Marcel. [Marcel doesn't react so Ross starts singing] In
the jungle, the mighty jungle the lion sleeps tonight. [no reaction from Marcel,
Monica and Joey urge him on] In the jungle, the mighty jungle the lion sleeps tonight.
[Marcel looks over and everyone joins in] a-weema-way, a-weema-way..... [Marcel
runs over and hops up on Ross's shoulder][Scene: The next time at the movie set.]
SECURITY GUARD: Uh, excuse me folks this is a uhh...
JOEY: Closed set. We know but we're friends with the monkey. [guard lets them in]
ROSS: Good morning. Hey pal, look who I brought. It's your old friend Harry Elefante.
[Marcel grabs the elephant doll and throws it to the ground]
JOEY: Woah, dude, burn.
ROSS: I don't get it, he seemed so happy to see me yesterday.
TRAINER: Hey don't take it personal, he's under a lot of pressure, ya know, starring in a
movie and all.
RACHEL: Now just how big of a star is Marcel?
TRAINER: In human terms, I'd say Cybill Shepard.
ALL: Woah.
CHANDLER: [to guys wering yellow isolation suits] So, are you guys in the movie, or are
you just really paranoid.
DIRECTOR'S ASSISTANT: Hey Sal, Jerry wants to know if the monkey's ready for the subway
set?
JOEY: Uh, excuse me. Jerry is the director, which one's he?
DIRECTOR'S ASSISTANT: The one in the director's chair.
JOEY: Gotcha. Phoebs, walk with me.
PHOEBE: OK. Um, how come I'm walking with you?
JOEY: Well, we're, we're just goin' over here so that we can get away from the horrible
flesh eating virus, for the love of God woman, listen to me. Is he lookin', is he
lookin'?
SUSIE: We've got a problem.
DIRECTOR'S ASSISTANT: Tell me.
SUSIE: I can't do Chris's makeup. She refuses to acknowledge that she has a moustasche.
DIRECTOR'S ASSISTANT: Is it bad?
SUSIE: It looks like one of her eyebrows fell down. Now unless someone convinces her to
let me bleach it, Jean-Claude Van Damme is gonna be making out with Gabe Kaplan.
DIRECTOR'S ASSISTANT: I'll talk to her.
SUSIE: I hate actors.
CHANDLER: [to an extra in fatigues] Nice camoflauge man, for a minute there I almost
didn't see ya.
SUSIE: Excuse me.
CHANDLER: Ahhhh.
SUSIE: Uh, is your name Chandler?
CHANDLER: Uh, yes, yes it is.
SUSIE: Chandler Bing?
CHANDLER: Do you know me or are you just really good at this game?
SUSIE: I'm Susie Moss. Fourth grade, glasses, I used to carry around a box of animal
crackers like a purse. 
CHANDLER: Susie Moss, right, yeah, wow, you look. . . great job growing up.
SUSIE: It's nice to see you're not still wearing that denim cap with all the little
mirrors on it.
CHANDLER: Oh, right, well yeah, I graduated fourth grade and realized I wasn't a pimp.
SUSIE: Remember the class play? You, you pulled up my skirt and the entire auditorium saw
my underpants.
CHANDLER: Yes, back then I, uh, used humor as a defense mechanism. Thank God I don't do
that anymore.
[cut to Monica and Rachel walking through the set]
MONICA: Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.
RACHEL: What what what what?
MONICA: Jean-Claude Van Damme. I didn't know he was in this movie, he is so hot.
RACHEL: Ya think?
MONICA: The muscles from Brussels, wham bam Van Damme, did you see Time Cop?
RACHEL: No, was he any good in it?
MONICA: Rachel, he like, totally changed time.
RACHEL: Wow, so why don't you go talk to him?
MONICA: Oh, yeah.
RACHEL: What, so you go over there, you tell him you think he's cute, what's the worst
that could happen?
MONICA: He could hear me.
RACHEL: OK, I'm doin' it for ya.
MONICA: Oh Rachel don't, don't you dare, don't, don't. Tell him I cook.
RACHEL: Excuse me. Hi.
VAN DAMME: Hi.
RACHEL: Um, this is gonna sound kinda goofy but uhhm, my friend over there, who cooks by
the way, um, she thinks you're cute.
VAN DAMME: You don't think I'm cute?
RACHEL: I, I don't know, um, do you think you're cute? OK, we're kinda gettin' off the
track here. Um, I was supposed to come here and tell you my friend thinks you're cute. So
what should I tell her?
VAN DAMME: You can tell her I think her friend is cute.
[back to Chandler and Susie]
CHANDLER: No, Stephen Hurs was the kid who would eat anything for money, David Stein was
the guy who had no elbows.
SUSIE: OK, well then who was the kid that got caught masturbating?
CHANDLER: OK that's not what he was doing. Alright, he was looking for his bus money.
[a voice in the background calls for makeup]
SUSIE: Oh that's me, I gotta go.
CHANDLER: Oh uh, o, OK.
SUSIE: Um, so listen, how many times am I gonna have to touch you on the arm before you
ask me on a date.
CHANDLER: Well, uh, let's try one more. . . there you go, say Ernie's, 8 o'clock.
SUSIE: I'll be there, and who knows, if things go well, maybe this time I'll get to see
your underwear.
CHANDLER: No one was around to hear that?
[back to Rachel and Monica]
MONICA: So what'd he say?
RACHEL: Agh, what a jerk. I kept talking about you and he kept asking me out. I mean,
naturally, you know, I said no.
MONICA: Well, thanks anyway.
RACHEL: He just kept asking, and asking, and asking, and asking, and asking, and asking.
MONICA: Rachel if you, if you want to go out with him, you can. Sound like a big jerk to
me but if that's what you want to do...
RACHEL: Jean-Claude she said yes, I'll see you tonight. Thank you.[Scene: Central Perk. Joey and the girls are sitting at the couches.]
RACHEL: And then Jean-Claude took me to that place Crossroads and that's where we hung out
with Drew Barrymore.
JOEY: Oh man, she's so smokin, she has got the greatest set of. . . no guys around, huh.
RACHEL: Does anybody need anything?
MONICA: Oh, I'll have an espresso. Oh acutally, I'll get it. If I ask you to, you'll
probably end up drinking it yourself.
RACHEL: That is so unfair.
PHOEBE: I know. Oh, like you would drink her coffee after what you did to her with Van
Damme.
[Ross enters]
ROSS: Hey Joey I have to cancel racketball for tonight, that was Marcel's trainer. He's
gonna let me have him for a couple of hours.
JOEY: You're blowin' me off for a monkey?
ROSS: Hey, we can rescedule for Saturday.
JOEY: Yeah, unless you hook up with a bunch of pigeons.
[Chandler enters]
CHANDLER: Hey, stick a fork in me, I am done.
PHOEBE: Stick a fork what?
CHANDLER: Like, when you're cooking a steak.
PHOEBE: Oh, OK, I don't eat meat.
CHANDLER: Well then, how do you know when vegetables are done?
PHOEBE: Well you know, you juist, you eat them and you can tell.
CHANDLER: OK, then, eat me, I'm done.
CHANDLER: I've met the perfect woman. OK, we're sitting on her couch, we're fooling
around, and then suddenly she turns to me and says, 'Do you ever want to do it in an
elevator?'
MONICA: What did you say?
CHANDLER: Ahh, I believe my exact words were, 'Flaign,en - sten'. I mean I didn't know
what to say, how do you know if you wanna do it on an elevator?
PHOEBE: Oh, you just know.[Scene: Chandler and Joey's apartment. Chandler and Susie are making out on the couch.]
SUSIE: Oh, shoot, we gotta go, got a reservation in 30 minutes.
CHANDLER: Oh no no no no, no no no no no no, you see, what I had planned shouldn't take
more that 2, 3 minutes tops.
SUSIE: Oh, 200 seconds of passion. We gotta go.
SUSIE: But um, here's an idea, have you ever worn women's underwear?
CHANDLER: Well, ye, yes, actually, but, uh, they were my Aunt Edna's, and there were three
of us in there.
SUSIE: Well I was thinking it would be um, kind of sexy if you wore mine tonight, at
dinner.
CHANDLER: You want me to wear your panties?
SUSIE: Could ya?
CHANDLER: Well, if I was wearing your underwear then, uh, what would you be wearing?. . .
You're swell.[Scene: Ross's apartment. Ross is setting up for his time with Marcel. Joey is there.]

Phoebe is mediating.]
PHOEBE: OK, Rachel, why don't you start talking first.
RACHEL: Alright, I feel that this is totally unjustified. [Monica starts making faces
behind her back] She gave me the green light, I did nothing but-. Do you think I can't see
you in the TV set?
PHOEBE: Alright Monica, if there is something that you would like to share...
MONICA: Ya know, you had no right to go out with him.
RACHEL: That is the most ridiculous.
MONICA: You sold me out.
RACHEL: I did not sell you out.
MONICA: Yes you did. Absolutely.
RACHEL: Would you let me talk. [flicks Monica on the forehead]
MONICA: Did you just flick me?
RACHEL: OK, well, you wouldn't let me finish and I was jus- [Monica flicks her back] Ow.
That hurt [flicks Monica]
MONICA: Quit flicking [flicks]
RACHEL: Ow, you stop flicking.
MONICA: You flicked me first.
[They keep flicking each other. This turns into slapping each other. This leads to
wrestling on the floor. All the while Phoebe is saying ""Happy thoughts"".
Eventually Phoebe gets fed up.]
PHOEBE: OK, now I'm gonna kick some ass.
[Phoebe grabs each of them by an ear]
MONICA AND RACHEL: Ow. Ow. Ow.
PHOEBE: Alright, now I will let go if you both stop.
RACHEL: Oh, what do you, you want me to stop seeing him, is that what you want?
MONICA: Uh-huh.
RACHEL: You want me to just call him up and tell him that you're seeing him instead?
That's what you want?
MONICA: OK.
RACHEL: Oh that's what you want.
MONICA: Yes.
RACHEL: Fine.
MONICA: Fine,

CHANDLER: I'm hangin in. . . and a little out.
JOEY: So, assistant to the director. That's a really exciting job, I mean, you must have a
ton of cool responsibilities.
DIRECTOR'S ASSISTANT: I have nothing to do with casting.
JOEY: So what're you guys gonna eat?
SUSIE: How come all I can think about is putting that ice in my mouth and licking you all
over?
CHANDLER: Because I went to an all boys high school and God is making up for it.
SUSIE: I want you right here, right now.
CHANDLER: Right now, right here. Don't ya think we're in kind of a public plaaaa [Susie
grabs him under the table] They do have the shrimp.

CHANDLER: I'm going to the bathroom now. [leaves for the bathroom]
[In the bathroom Susie and Chandler are kissing. She backs into a stall.]
SUSIE: C'mon.

SUSIE: Alright mister, let's see those panties.
CHANDLER: Alrighty. [we see Chandler's pants drop from under the stall door]
SUSIE: Ooh. Ooh. But ya know what would be even sexier?
CHANDLER: What?
SUSIE: If you didn't have your shirt tucked into them.
CHANDLER: Oh.
SUSIE: Alright. Now I would like to see you wearing nothing but them. Take your clothes
off.
CHANDLER: OK, but uh, I hope you realize this means we're gonna miss hearing about the
specials.
SUSIE: C'mon hurry, hurry.
CHANDLER: Hey, do you want this done quick, or do you want this done right?
SUSIE: Alright, turn around. Time to see you from behind.
CHANDLER: OK.
[She turns him facing the toilet and sneaks out of the stall and gathers up his clothes.]
SUSIE: Oh, somebody's been doing his buns of steel video.
CHANDLER: Well, you want me to uh, clench anything, or-... Susie? Susie.
SUSIE: This is for the fourth grade.
CHANDLER: Huh? Where, whaddya mean?
SUSIE: Whaddo I mean. Whaddya mean, whaddo I mean? I mean underpants, mister, that's what
I mean.
CHANDLER: What, what's what you mean?
SUSIE: My skirt, you lifted, kids laughing. I was Susie Underpants 'till I was 18.
CHANDLER: That was in the fourth grade. How could you still be upset about that?
SUSIE: Well um, why don't you call me in 20 years and tell me if you're still upset about
this. [she leaves with his clothes]
CHANDLER: Alright, I hope you realize you're not getting these underpants back.[Scene: Monica and Van Damme are walking down the street.]
MONICA: I can't believe this, just like 2 weeks ago I was watching Sudden Death,
now I'm on a date with Jean-Claude Van Damme. Can you beat up that guy? [he nods] Can you
beat up that guy?
VAN DAMME: Sure.
MONICA: This is so wild. Ya know, I gotta admit, I was kinda surprised that you agreed to
go on a blind date.
VAN DAMME: Normally, I would not do it.
MONICA: Well, what made you make the exception for me?
VAN DAMME: 'Cause Rachel told me uh, you were dying to have a threesome with me and uh,
Drew Barrymore. By the way, Drew has some groundrules and...[Scene: Back at Monica and Rachel's apartment. They are now fighting about what Rachel
told Van Damme.]
MONICA: Say you're sorry.
RACHEL: No. [hitting each other]
MONICA: Say it.
RACHEL: No. [hitting again]
[Monica grabs Rachel by the sweater. Rachel squirms out of it]
MONICA: Rachel, you say you're sorry or your sweater gets it.
RACHEL: OK, OK, that is my favorite sweater, that is my third date sweater.
MONICA: Say you're sorry.
RACHEL: OK, you wanna play? OK, let's play, let's play. [She grabs a jar of tomato sauce
and Monica's purse]
MONICA: What're you gonna do?
RACHEL: You give me back my sweater or it's handbag marinara.
MONICA: You don't have the guts.
RACHEL: Oh yeah. Well, at least I wasn't too chicken to tell some guy I thought he was
cute.
[Monica pulls a thread on Rachel's sweater and Rachel dumps the tomato sauce in Monica's
purse]
PHOEBE: Oh alright, stop, STOP THE MADNESS. This is crazy. Who can even remember
why this even started in the first place?
[Monica and Rachel start yelling at the same time]
PHOEBE: Yes that's right. But still, I-, look at your purse, look at your sweater, look at
yourselves.
MONICA: I'll help you fix your sweater.
RACHEL: I'll help you throw out your purse.
MONICA: I'm sorry that I made you stop seeing him.

boss. I mean, c'mon what is this, 1922?
RACHEL: What's 1922?
PHOEBE: Just, you know, long time ago. Well, when men used to tell women what to do - a
lot. And then there was suffrage, which is a good thing but is sounds horrible. Do you
want to get this tattoo?

have one.
MRS. GELLER: I have no idea. Did you know Richard has a twinkie in the city?
MR. GELLER: I know. He's like a new man. It's like a scene from Cocoon.
MRS. GELLER: I just never would have pictured Richard with a bimbo.
MR. GELLER: Apparently, he told Johnny Shapiro that she's quite a girl. In fact, he told
Johnny that he thinks he's falling in love with her.
MRS. GELLER: Really.
MR. GELLER: I tell you, I've never seen him this happy.

CHANDLER: Well it wouldn't kill you to say it once in a while.
JOEY: Alright, you want the truth? I'm thinkin' about it.
CHANDLER: What?
JOEY: I'm sorry. I'm 28 years old, I've never lived alone, and I'm finally at a place
where I've got enough money that I don't need a roommate anymore.
CHANDLER: Woah, woah, woah. I don't need a roommate either, OK? I can afford to live here
by myself. Ya know, I may have to bring in somebody once a week to lick the silverware.
JOEY: What're you gettin' so bent out of shape for, huh? It's not like we agreed to live
together forever. We're not Bert and Ernie.
CHANDLER: Look, you know what? If this is the way you feel, then maybe you should take it.
JOEY: Well that's how I feel.
CHANDLER: Well then maybe you should take it.

MRS. GELLER: Oh?
RICHARD: Oh?
ROSS: Ohh.
MRS. GELLER: She never tells us anything. Ross, did you know Monica's seeing someone?
ROSS: Mom, there are so many people in my life. Some of them are seeing people and some of
them aren't. Is that crystal?
MRS. GELLER: So, who's the mystery man?
MONICA: Well, uh, he's a doctor.
MRS. GELLER: A real doctor?
MONICA: No, a doctor of meat. Of course he's a real doctor. And he's handsome, and he's
sweet, and know you'd like him. [she puts her arm around Richard]

CHANDLER: That's right my friend. It's time for...
BOTH: Baywatch!! [both turn on TV's]
JOEY: Oh, can you believe they gave Stephanie skin cancer?
CHANDLER: I still can't believe they promoted her to lieutenant.
JOEY: Naa, you're just sayin' that 'cause you're in love with Yasmine Blepe.
CHANDLER: Well, how could anyone not be in love with Yasmine Blepe?
JOEY: Hey, hey, they're runnin'
CHANDLER: See, this is the brilliance of the show. I say always keep them running. All the
time, running. Run. Run Yasmine, run like the wind.[Scene: Central Perk. Joey is sitting between Monica and Phoebe.]
MONICA: But I thought you wanted to live by yourself.
JOEY: I did. I thought it'd be great. I figured I'd have like, time alone with my thoughts
but, ya know, it turns out I don't have as many thoughts as you'd think.
PHOEBE: Joey, why don't you talk to Chandler about moving back?
JOEY: You really think he'd take me? I mean, we had a pretty good talk last night but,
when I moved out, I hurt him bad.
MONICA: I promise you, he would definitely want you back.[Scene: Chandler's apartment. Chandler is sitting between Rachel and Ross.]
ROSS: I'm telling you, there's no way he's moving back.
CHANDLER: But we had one of the greatest talks we ever had last night. I mean it was, it
was like when we first started living together.
ROSS: Look, I know you don't want to hear this right now but, we've seen him in his new
place, alright. And he's happy, he's, he's decorated.
RACHEL: Look, Chandler, he has moved on, OK, you have to too.
CHANDLER: But...
ROSS: No. You're just gonna have to accept the fact that you're just friends now, OK,
you're not... rommmates anymore.[Scene: Recording studio. Phoebe is getting ready to record Smelly Cat.]
PRODUCER: OK Phoebe, you ready to try one?

[back up singers - smelly, smelly, smelly, really bad smelly cat, it's not your fault]
OK, sorry. I'm just, I'm just not getting that everyone um, gets how smelly this cat
acually is. I just think that maybe if we could talk about this, 'cause I need to feel
that you really care about the cat.
PRODUCER: Honey, uh we, we can talk about this. It's just that it's costing about a
hundred dollars a minute to be in here.
PHOEBE: Oh OK. So, um, the cat stinks but you love it, let's go.[Scene: Monica and Chandler's apartment. Ross is on the phone.]
ROSS: No, there is no way he was a velociraptor. No Tony, look at the cranial ridge, OK.
If Dino was a velociraptor, he would have eaten the Flintstones. Yeah, yeah. [Monica comes
out of her room] Oh, were you takin' a nap?
MONICA: I was.

Hello. Oh yeah she's here but uh, can she call you back? OK thanks. [hangs up the other
line] Call Joanna. [back on with Tony] Hi.
MONICA: Did she leave a number?
ROSS: Did you see me write one down?
MONICA: I don't have her number, butt-munch.
ROSS: Well, she'll call back, don't be such a baby.
MONICA: I'm not a baby, you're the baby.
ROSS: Look, you wanna get off my back?
MONICA: You wanna get out of my face?
ROSS: Wait hold on Tony, hold on. [answers second line] Hello. Hi, yeah no, she's right

watches in disbeliefe]

CHANDLER: Alright, so what's it about?
JOEY: Eggs. Who's eggs do you like better, his or mine, huh?
CHANDLER: Well I like both eggs equally.
JOEY: Oh come on. Nobody likes two different kinds of eggs equally. You like one better
than the other and I wanna know which.
CHANDLER: Well what's the difference? Your eggs aren't here anymore, are they? You took
your eggs and you left. You really expect me to never find new eggs?[Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. Ross and Monica are fighting over the remote.]
MONICA: I wanna watch Entertainment Tonight.

MONICA: I just can't stand you being here all the time.
ROSS: Why, why, why can't you stand me being here? I don't, I, we're just, ya know, we're
just havin' fun.
MONICA: Fun? Fun, you think this is fun?
ROSS: Yeah, c'mon I mean I though, you know, I thought we're just foolin' around. Like
when, uh, when we were kids.
MONICA: Ross, I hated you when we were kids.
ROSS: You hated me when we were kids?
MONICA: Yes. I hated you. I mean I, I, loved you in a 'you're my brother so I have to'
kind of way, but basically, yeah, I hated your guts.
ROSS: Why did you hate me?
MONICA: Because, you were mean to me and you, you teased me and you always, always got
your way.
ROSS: And that wasn't fun for you?
MONICA: Duh-huh!
ROSS: I can't believe you hated me.
MONICA: Now I love you. And not just 'cause I have to.
ROSS: Really?
MONICA: Yeah. You're just gonna have to stop pissing me off.
ROSS: I can do that.
MONICA: Then I won't have to kill you.
ROSS: So you wanna watch uh, Entertainment Tonight?
MONICA: Yeah, thanks. You know what?
ROSS: What?
MONICA: If you really want to watch that Serengetti thing, you can.

PHOEBE: Listen. You are not going to believe this but, that is not me singing on the
video.
ALL: No.
PHOEBE: Yes.
RACHEL: Well, how did you find out?
PHOEBE: Well, OK, the record company sent over this piece of paper for me to sign, saying
that it's OK for someone else to sing for me. That was my first clue.
MONICA: So what're you gonna do?
PHOEBE: Well, I can't work with people who would do this.
MONICA: Sure.
PHOEBE: I mean this poor woman.
ROSS: What woman?
PHOEBE: The voice woman. Ya know, I mean, she has a great voice but she doesn't have a
video.
RACHEL: OK, Phoebs. But what about you?
PHOEBE: Well I have a video, you have to pay attention. No this, this voice woman, she's
so talented but, according to the producer people, they said she doesn't have like the
right look or something, ya know. I mean, it's like, she's like one of those an imals at
the pound who like nobody wants 'cause they're not pretty enough or you know. Like, like
some old dog who's just kind of like stinky and. Huuuuh, oh my God, she's smelly cat. Oh,
oh that song has so many levels.[Scene: Chandler and Eddie's apartment.]

EDDIE: Y-, y-, you like that show?
CHANDLER: You don't like that show?
EDDIE: Wha-, n-, no. I mean it's just a bunch of pretty people runnin' around on the
beach, ya know.
CHANDLER: Well that's the brilliance of it. The pretty people... and the running.
EDDIE: I tell ya, I-, I'm gonna go read in my room for a little while.
CHANDLER: Oh o-, OK man.

Phoebe to play a game with him.] CHANDLER: Phoebs, play with meeee.

bar, forced to play soccer forever. Ahh, hello, human-rights violation. CHANDLER: Ya know Phoebs, don't feel so bad for 'em. After they're
done playing, I break out the little plastic women and everybody has a pretty good time.

PHOEBE: Uh oh, ooh, are we not getting along with the new boy?
CHANDLER: No he's, he's alright, just uh, he spends most of his time in his room.
PHOEBE: Maybe that's because you haven't taken the time to get to know him. Let's remedy
that, shall we?
CHANDLER: We don't need to remedy that.
PHOEBE: Oh yeah, it'll be fun. [throws a tennis ball at Eddie's bedroom door]

says, 'Eddie.' I say, 'yeah,' she says, 'Eddie, I don't want to see you anymore.' And it
was literally like she had reached into my chest, ripped out my heart, and smeared it all
over my life, ya know. And now there's like this incredible abyss, ya know, and I'm
falling and I keep falling and I don't think I'm ever gonna stop. [finishes laughing] That

JOEY: Phoebs, check it out, check it out, check it out, check it out.
PHOEBE: Oh, ooh, Soap Opera Digest, oh that's one of my favorite digests.
JOEY: Page 42, page 42, page 42.
PHOEBE: Ok, ok, ok. Ooh, hey 'new doc on the block, Days of Our Lives' Joey Tribbiani.'
Ooh, cool picture.
JOEY: Ooh, I look good. PHOEBE: Hey is this true, that you write a lot of your own lines?
JOEY: Uh, well, kinda yeah. Like, remember last week when Alex was in the accident? Well
the line in the script was, 'If we don't get this woman to a hospital, she's going to
die.' But I made it, ' If this woman doesn't get to a hospital, she's not gonna live.'
PHOEBE: Ohh, ok, I see what you did there. Aren't you afraid though, that the writers are
gonna be kinda mad when they read this?
JOEY: Huh? Never really thought about the writers. The scripts just kinda come to my
house. But you know what? This makes me look good, which makes the show look good, which
makes the writers look good so how could they be mad about that?[Scene: At a writer's desk. The writer is working on a script for Days of Our Lives.]
WRITER: Makes up most of his lines. Son-of-a-. Yeah, well, write this jerkweed.[Scene: Joey's apartment. The next script is being delivered.]
JOEY: I fall down an elevator shaft? What the hell does this mean, I fall down an elevator
shaft?
DELIVERY GUY: Uhh, I don't know, I just bring the scripts.
JOEY: They can't kill me, I'm Francesca's long lost son. DELIVERY GUY: Right. Could you sign this?
JOEY: No. No way, I'm not signing that.
DELIVERY GUY: I don't think that's gonna affect the plot of the show.
JOEY: How can they do this to me?
DELIVERY GUY: Er, uh, I'm just gonna go. Sorry.[Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. Monica, Richard, Ross, and Rachel are
returning.] MONICA: Well it wasn't that many guys. I mean, if you consider how
many guys there actually are, it's a very small percentage.
RACHEL: Hey, it's not that big a deal, I was just curious.
ROSS: G'night.
RICHARD: Night Richard. Good luck Mon. MONICA: Alright, before I tell you, uh, why don't you tell me how
many women you've been with.
RICHARD: Two.
MONICA: Two? TWO? How is that possible? I mean, have you seen you?
RICHARD: Well, I mean what can I say? I, I was married to Barbara for 30 years. She was my
high school sweetheart, now you, that's two.
MONICA: Two it is. Ok, time for bed, I'm gonna go brush my teeth. [goes in the bathroom] RICHARD: Woah, woah, no wait a minute now. C'mon it's your turn. Oh
c'mon. Ya know, I don't need the actual number, just a ballpark.
MONICA: Ok, it is definitely less than a ballpark.
[Rachel's bedroom]
RACHEL: Wow, I am so glad I'm not Monica right now.
ROSS: Tell me about it. So what, what's your magic number?
RACHEL: Uhhhooo. ROSS: C'mon, you know everyone I've been with. All, both of them. RACHEL: Well, there's you.
ROSS: Better not be doin' these in order.
RACHEL: Ok, uh, Billy Dreskin, Pete Carney, Barry, and uh, oh, Paolo.
ROSS: Oh yes, the weenie from Torrini.
RACHEL: Oh honey, are you jealous of Paolo? Oh, c'mon, I'm so much happier with you than I
ever was with him.
ROSS: Really? RACHEL: Oh please. That Paolo thing was barely a relationship. All
it really was was just, ya know, meaningless animal sex. Ok, ya know, that sounded soooo
much better in my head.[Scene: Chandler and Eddie's apartment.]
CHANDLER: Eddie, I didn't sleep with your ex-girlfriend.
EDDIE: That's very interesting, ya know, 'cause that's exactly what someone who slept with
her would say.
CHANDLER: This is nuts. This is crazy. She came over for like two minutes, dropped off a
fish tank, and left, end of story.
EDDIE: Where's Buddy?
CHANDLER: Buddy?
EDDIE: My fish, Buddy.
CHANDLER: There was no fish when she dropped it off.
EDDIE: Oh, this is, this is unbelievable. I mean, first you sleep with my ex-girlfriend
then you insult my inteligenct by lying about it and then you kill my fish, my Buddy? CHANDLER: Hey I didn't kill your fish. Look Eddie...[puts his hand
on Eddie's shoulder] Would you look at what I'm doin' here. That can't be smart. So we're
just gonna take this guy right off ya and put him here in Mr. Pocket. Tangellon? [picks up
the fruit an tosses it to Eddie, it hits Eddie in the chest and falls][Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. Monica and Richard are in Monica's bedroom.]
RICHARD: That's it? That's the giant number you were afraid to tell me?
MONICA: Well yeah.
RICHARD: Well, that's not bad at all. I mean, you had me thinkin it was like a fleet.
MONICA: You really ok with it?
RICHARD: Oh honey, I'm fine.
MONICA: Oh, yay. Ok about that two.
RICHARD: What? Alright, what about my two?
MONICA: Well, it just seems like a really small number.
RICHARD: Right, and...
MONICA: And, well, don't you have a lot of wild oats to sew? Or is that what you're doing
with me? Oh my God, am I an oat?
RICHARD: Honey, you are not an oat. I, I mean I don't know, I, I guess I'm just not an oat
guy. I've only slept with women I've been in love with.
MONICA: But you've only slept with two people.
RICHARD: Right.
MONICA: Wow. Oh wow. You know I love you too, right.
RICHARD: Now I do. [they kiss and fall to the bed]
[Ross and Rachel are in Rachel's bedroom] RACHEL: Ross, Ross, please listen to me. Ross, you are so much
better for me than Paolo ever was. I mean you care about me, you're loving, you make me
laugh.
ROSS: Oh, hey, if I make you laugh, here's an idea, why don't you invite Paulo over and
have a little romp in the sack and I'll just stand in the corner and tell knock-knock
jokes.
RACHEL: God, Ross, look, what you and I have is special, all Paolo and I ever had was... ROSS: Animal sex, animal sex? So what're you saying, I mean, you're
saying that like, there's nothing between us animal at all. I mean there's not even like,
uhm, a little animal, not even, not even like, like chipmunk sex?
RACHEL: Ok, Ross, try to hear me. Ok, I, hey, I'm not gonna lie to you. Ok, it was good
with Paolo.
ROSS: Knock-knock.
RACHEL: But, what you and I have is so much better. Ok, we have tenderness, we have

CHANDLER: So, when I woke up this morning, he'd stolen all the insoles out of my shoes.
MONICA: Why?
CHANDLER: Because he thinks I slept with his ex-girlfriend and killed his fish. PHOEBE: Why would you kill his fish?
CHANDLER: Because sometimes, Phoebe after you sleep with someone, you have to kill the
fish.

JOEY: I don't know, I was kinda hopin' no one would ever find out.
RACHEL: Well, maybe they can find a way to bring you back. JOEY: Naa, they said that when they found my body, my brain was so
smashed in that the only doctor that could have saved me was me. Supposed to be some kind
of irony or somethin. PHOEBE: But Joey, you're gonna be fine. You don't need that show, it
was just a dumb soap opera.
JOEY: Phoebe, this was the greatest thing that ever happened to me.
PHOEBE: Yes, I was going to incorporate that. Oh good, here's Monica, she'll have
something nice to say.
MONICA: Um, I straightened out your shower curtain so you won't get mildew. What? To me
that's nice.
CHANDLER: It's gonna be ok. You know that?
JOEY: No, I don't. It's like, ya know, you work your whole life for somethin' and you
think that when you get it it's never gonna be as good as you thought it would be. But
this so was. Ya know, it changed everything. Like the other day, I got this credit card
application, and I was pre- approved. Huh? I've never been pre-approved for anything in my

PHOEBE: Ya-huh, all the time, cause they are the lightning bearers.
RACHEL: Wow.
PHOEBE: Yeah.
RACHEL: Well that sounds kinda cool, kinda like The Hobbit.
MONICA: It is nothing like the Hobbit. It's like reading about every relationship I've
ever had, except for Richard. PHOEBE: Oh yes, no, Richard would never steal your wind.
MONICA: No.
PHOEBE: No, 'cause he's yummy.
MONICA: Yes. But all the other ones.

MONICA: Hey.
ROSS: Uh, sweetie we've gotta go.

ROSS: No? RACHEL: No, why do we always have to do everything according to your

ROSS: Actually it's the movie theatre that has the time schedule. So you don't miss the
beginning.

ROSS: Excuse me, your, your, your wind? RACHEL: Yes, my wind. How do you expect me to grow if you won't let
me blow?

pretty upset about it.

'Hang in there,' and, and, 'Somethin' big's fonna come along, I know it.'
ROSS: But I don't know it. What I do know is that you owe $2300 at Isn't it Chromantic.

knows how long it's gonna be till you get another.

something else you're supposed to be doing right now?

I'm a dehydrating maniac!

ROSS: What're you talkin' about? PHOEBE: C'mon, happy family gets a dog, frontier fun.
ROSS: Yeah but Phoebs, what about the end?
PHOEBE: What when Yeller saves saves the family from the wolf and everyone's happy? RACHEL: That's not the end.
PHOEBE: Yu-huh. That's when my mother would shut off the TV and say 'The end'.
MONICA: What about the part where he has rabies?
PHOEBE: He doesn't have rabies, he has babies. That's what my mom said.
RICHARD: Uh, Phoebe, I don't think your mom would want you to see what's about to happen. PHOEBE: What, what's about to happen? [starts watching] I've never
seen this part before. Hey, Travis, watcha doin' with that gun? Oh no, no no Travis, put
down the gun. No no no no, he he's your buddy, he's your Yeller, no, no no, the end, THE
END. [hear the gunshot from the TV] [Scene:Monica and Rachel's apartment. Richard is on the balcony smoking and Monica is
on the phone.] MONICA: Hey, have you guys eaten, because uh, Richard and I just
finished and we've got leftovers... Chicken and potatoes... What am I wearing?...Actually,
nothing but rubber gloves.
[Chandler and Joey come sprinting in]
JOEY: Ya know, one of these times you're gonna really be naked and we're not gonna come
over. MONICA: Alright, I've got a leg, three breasts and a wing.
CHANDLER: Well, how do you find clothes that fit? JOEY: Oh, hey, Monica, we've got a question.
MONICA: Alright, for the bizillionth time, yes I see other women in shower at the gym, and
no I don't look.
JOEY: No, not that one. We're trying to figure out who to bring to the Knicks game
tonight, we have an extra ticket.
CHANDLER: Yeah, Ross can't go so it's between my friend Eric Prower who has breath issues
and Dan with the poking. [starts poking Monica in the shoulder] 'Did you see that play? Do
you want some more beer? Is that Spike Lee?' MONICA: Ok. [Richard walks in] Hey, why don't you ask Richard?
JOEY: Ok, uh, hey Richard, if you had an extra ticket to the Knicks game and you had to
choose between a friend who smells and one who bruises you who would you pick? RICHARD: Wow. Well being a huge Knicks fan myself, I think you
should take someone who's a huge Knicks fan.
CHANDLER: Ok, that's Eric.
RICHARD: Glad to be of help. Matches. [walks out to the balcony]
MONICA: I meant, why don't you take Richard to the game? What?
JOEY: I don't know.
MONICA: C'mon. Keeps his fingers to himself and he's always minty fresh. CHANDLER: I don't know, Richard's really nice and everything, uh,
it's just that we don't know him really well, ya know, and plus he's, ya know, old [Monica
gives him a glare] -er than some people, but, uh, younger than some buildings.
MONICA: So what, he's a little older, big deal, I mean he's important to me. Ya know if
you ask him, he might take you on his Jag. [walks off] JOEY: How do we say yes now and make it seem like we're not doin' it
just to ride in the cool car?
CHANDLER: Ok, this could be tough.
JOEY: [Monica walks back in the kitchen] Ok ok ok ok. Monica, we'll bring him, but only if
he takes the Jaguar.
CHANDLER: Ooh, you almost had it.[Scene: Ross's apartment. Ross is holding Ben.]
ROSS: [smells Ben's butt] No no, you're fine, you're fine.
CAROL: [enters with Susan] Hello
ROSS: Hi.
SUSAN: Hey.
CAROL: Hi honey.
ROSS: Oh you guys are not gonna believe what happened.
CAROL: What?
SUSAN: What? ROSS: Ok, we were sitting over there playing on the floor and he
grabs the table and he pulls himself up. He pulled himself up. Standing man. I'm sorry you
guys missed it but I did tape it so it you guys want to see it.
CAROL: Uhh, we know, he already did it last week.
SUSAN: You can watch our tape if you want. 
ROSS: I don't believe this. I miss, I miss the first time of everything. I missed, what,
the first time he rolled over, the first time he crawled. What else did I miss? Has he
spoken yet, is he driving, does he have a favorite liquour?
CAROL: Actually, he is getting closer on the talking thing. He can't quite say mama yet,
but once he said yumen. ROSS: Ooh, I, I'm so sick of missing stuff. Ya know, I want him for
more than, than a day, I want him for a whole weekend. No listen , I mean, I feel like-
CAROL and SUSAN: Great. That would be fine.
ROSS: Really? I mean, I, I had a whole speach prepared.
SUSAN: Oh shout, that would have been fun.
ROSS: Oh look, did, did you just see that? Did you see? He just waved, he just waved, he's
never waved before, you've never waved before. Yes he has. Very good.[Scene: Central Perk. Monica and Rachel are there. Phoebe enters carrying video tapes.]
PHOEBE: Hey.
RACHEL: Hey Phoebs, whatcha got there?
PHOEBE: Ok, Love Story, Brian's Song, and Terms of Endearment.
MONICA: Wow, all you need now is The Killing Fields and some guacamole and you've
got yourself a part-ay. PHOEBE: Yeah, I talked to my grandma about the Old Yeller
incident, and she told me that my mom used to not show us the ends of sad movies to shield
us from the pain and sadness. You know, before she killed herself.
[Chandler and Joey enter]
CHANDLER: Hey.
JOEY: Hey.
RACHEL: Hey. MONICA: Hey. Where is he, where's Richard? Did you ditch him?
JOEY: Yeah right after we stole his lunch money and gave him a wedgie. What's the matter
with you, he's parking the car.
MONICA: So'd you guys have fun?
CHANDLER: Your boyfriend is so cool.
MONICA: Really? CHANDLER: Yeah, he let us drive his Jaguar. Joey for 12 blocks, me
for 15.
RACHEL: Wow, he must like you the best. JOEY: Oh, what about that thing he did when he tipped the guy who
showed us to our seats. You never even saw the money, it was like this. [With money in his
palm] Hey Chandler, thanks for showing us to our seats [shakes his had and passes the
dollar].
CHANDLER: You're welcome. Hey Joey, thanks for parking the car [passes the dollar back].
JOEY: No problem. Hey Chandler
CHANDLER: I think they get it.
JOEY: Ok.
[Richard enters]
CHANDLER: There's the man.
JOEY: He-he-eyy. [Shakes his had and passes the dollar]
RICHARD: Hey, you're gettin' better. I'm gonna keep this by the way.
JOEY: Ok. He kept my dollar.[Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. Carol and Susan are dropping off Ben.]
MONICA: So your first whole weekend without Ben, what're you guys gonna do? CAROL: Uh, we're going down to Colonial Williamsburg.
SUSAN: Yeah, a woman I went to college with just became the first female blacksmith down
there.
ROSS: Well, ya know, they're a little behind the times in Colonial Williamsburg.
CAROL: Think I better go before mommy starts weeping.
ROSS: Buy mommy.
CAROL and SUSAN: We love you. Buy.
ROSS: Have a good time. Ok, Ben.
MONICA: Ross.
ROSS: Yeah. MONICA: Look. [they look at Joey in the kitchen with a cigar in his
mouth, looking at his reflection in a spatula] Joey, do you know we can see you from here? JOEY: How come Richard looks so much cooler with one of these than
me?
ROSS: Well for starters, you may want to light it and lose the spatula.
MONICA: You know what, I think it's cute, you trying to be more like Richard.
JOEY: Not like him, per-se, just not un-like him.
[Chandler enters with his hair full of mousse and a cheesy moustache] ROSS: Look it's the artist formerly known as Chandler.
CHANDLER: Just tryin' somethin' here, ya know. MONICA: So Joey, why didn't you grow a moustache?
JOEY: Oh we flipped for it. I got the cigar, he got the moustache. Figured if we both grew
it, we'd look like dorks.
ROSS: Yeah, you really sidestepped that land mine.
CHANDLER: Hey listen, we've gotta go, I promised Richard we'd meet him downstairs.
MONICA: You're meeting Richard?
JOEY: Yeah, we're goin' to a Ranger game.
CHANDLER: Yeah, didn't he tell ya?
MONICA: Well, he told me he was going out with the guys, I just didn't know that you were
the guys.
CHANDLER: You hear that? We're the guys.
JOEY: We're the guys.
MONICA: With that moustache doesn't Chandler remind you of Aunt Sylvia?
ROSS: Thank you.[Scene: Central Perk. Rachel is working. Ross enters with Ben.] ROSS: Hi, we're visitiing. It's Ben and his da-da. Da-da. Can you
say da-da? Look, I'm gonna tell your momies you said it anyway so you might as well try.
RACHEL: No luck huh?
ROSS: Naa. A while ago I got a sah out of him, which I thought, ya know, might turn into
sah-condary caregiver but... Hey, would you uh, would you hold him for a sec, 'cause I, I
gotta take this off.
RACHEL: Oh, yeah sure, Ok. [she takes Ben and holds him at arms length] ROSS: What're you doing?
RACHEL: Uh, I'm holding Ben.
ROSS: Yeah, well, he's a baby not a bomb.
RACHEL: Ok. ROSS: Well just hold him like you'd hold a football.
RACHEL: This is how I would hold a football.
ROSS: Ok, here, here. There we go.
RACHEL: Ok, I'm sorry, I'm just not very good with babies. I mean I haven't been around
them, I mean, you know, since I was one.
ROSS: It's alright, it's no big deal.
RACHEL: Really?
ROSS: Yeah, definitely, I'm sure you'll feel totally different when it's our baby.
RACHEL: What?
ROSS: What?
RACHEL: You think about stuff like that?
ROSS: Uhh, yeah. I mean, actually I kinda think that we'll have, we'll have two babies.
RACHEL: Two, two babies?
ROSS: Yeah. Ya know, a boy and a girl. Hopefully the girl will come first so Ben here
won't feel too competitive.
RACHEL: Then what's gonna happen?
ROSS: Well, we won't wanna raise kids in the city so we'll probably move to uh, Scarsdale.
RACHEL: Uh-huh.
ROSS: Yeah, that way I figure, ya know, we'll be far enough away from our parents that we
don't have to see them all the time but close enough that they can come over and babysit
whenever we want. And yes, I know, the taxes are a little higher than, let's say, Nassau
county but the school system's supposedly great.
RACHEL: Wow. Wow, that's great. Great. Ok, wow, you know what.
ROSS: Huh?
RACHEL: I'm off my break now so uh, um here you take this [hands back Ben] and um, I am
gonna go pour these very nice people some coffee. Ok. Oh look at that, I don't have a pot.
I don't have a pot. Well, hey, maybe I've got one at home, or in Scarsdale. Hey is that a
door? [leaves][Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. Monica and Richard are there. Phoebe enters.]
PHOEBE: Hey.
RICHARD: Hey Phoebs, what's happening?
PHOEBE: Oh, ok, murder, cancer, soccer teams eating each other in the Andes.
MONICA: So you watched the movies huh?
PHOEBE: Uh huh, what is happening to the world? I mean, no no no, 'cause ET leaves, and
and Rocky loses, Charlotte dies.
RICHARD: Charlotte who?
PHOEBE: With the web, the spider she dies, she does. She has babies and dies. It's like ya
know, hey welcome home from the hospital, thud.
MONICA: Alright, you wanna feel better?
PHOEBE: Yeah.
MONICA: Ok, here, watch this. PHOEBE: It's a Wonderful Life. Yes I've heard of this.
MONICA: So you can't lose, it's there in the title. Wonderfullness is baked right in.
PHOEBE: Please, I almost fell for that with, uh, Pride of the Yankees, I thought I
was gonna see a film about Yankee pride and then, boom, the guy gets Lou Gehrig's disease.
RICHARD: Uh, the guy was Lou Gehrig. Didn't you kinda see it coming?
PHOEBE: Phoebe, just watch that, I promise it will resotre all your faith in humanity. CHANDLER: [runs in] Hey, big guy, game time.
RICHARD: Hey, be right there.
MONICA: There's a game?
CHANDLER: Uh, yeah, I just got my pick-up sticks back from the shop. Bring your nerves of
steel.
RICHARD: It's the basketball playoffs.
MONICA: Listen, um honey, I appreciate this but you don't have to keep hanging out with
them for me, I mean, they have each other. RICHARD: Oh, no, honey, I mean, don't worry, I like hanging out with
those guys. It's fun for me. They're different than my other friends, they don't start
sentences with, 'You know who just died shoveling snow?' MONICA: Alright that's great, then just go. Go Knicks.
RICHARD: Uh, it's the college playoffs.
MONICA: Oh, then go Vassar.
RICHARD: Uh, they're not in it.
MONICA: Ok, then just go.
RICHARD: Ok. [leaves]
MONICA: Oh, why does this bother me so much? I mean I don't wanna be one of those people
who tells their boyfriend they wanna spend 24 hours a day with them.
PHOEBE: Sure. MONICA: It's just that he doesn't have that much free time, ya know,
and I don't know, what do I do?
PHOEBE: Does it matter? You're ultimately just gonna die or get divorced or have to blow
your pets head off.
RACHEL: [enters] Aghh.
PHOEBE: Me too. [leaves]
MONICA: I've got a question. Richard made plans again with the guys.
RACHEL: Yeah well, Ross just made plans for the whole century. MONICA: Ya know what, I think I'm gonna go to my room and read
Cosmo, maybe there's something helpful in there. Know what, at least maybe I can learn how
to do an at home bikini wax with leftover Cristmas candles.
ROSS: [enters] Ok, what the hell happened back there?
RACHEL: I don't know, you tell me. One minute I'm holding Ben like a football, the next
thing I know, I've got two kids, I'm living in Scarsdale complaining about the taxes. ROSS: Well I'm sorry, I think about stuff. Ya know, I mean, you're
at work, you're assembling bones, your mind wanders.
RACHEL: Ross, you have planned out the next 20 years of our lives, we've been dating for
six weeks.
ROSS: C'mon, what, you never think about our future? RACHEL: Yes, but I, I think about who's apartment we're gonna sleep
at tomorrow night and, and where we're gonna have dinner next Saturday night. I do not
think about what our childrens' names are gonna be. You know what our childrens names are
gonna be.
ROSS: No, no, I mean, ya know, I, I read a book and there was a girl named Emily and I
thought, I thought that might be good.
RACHEL: What was the book?
ROSS: The big book of childrens' names.
RACHEL: Ok, Ross, Ross, ok listen, what we have is amazing.
ROSS: Yeah.
RACHEL: But I do not want to have everything decided for me. I spent my whole life like
that. It's what I had with Barry, that was one of the reasons I left. I, I like not
knowing right now and I'm sorry if that scares you but if you want to be with me you are
gonna have to deal with that.
ROSS: Ok fine.
RACHEL: Thank you.
ROSS: We're not done.
RACHEL: I didn't know that. ROSS: Ok, then you're gonna have to understand that you're with a
guy who's not gonna stop planning his future with you because he knows that we're gonna
end up together and if that scares you, tough, 'cause you're gonna have to deal with that.
RACHEL: Fine, I will.
ROSS: Good, 'cause I love you.
RACHEL: Oh yeah.
ROSS: Yeah.
RACHEL: Well I love you too.
ROSS: Well that's the first time we've said that.
RACHEL: Yes it is.
ROSS: Well, I'm gonna kiss you.
RACHEL: Well you better.[Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. Monica is in the kitchen, Phoebe enters.] PHOEBE: Hey. Oh thanks for the great movie tip.
MONICA: Did you like it?
PHOEBE: Oh yeah. You know, I don't know if I was happier when um George Bailey destroyed
the family business or um, Donna Reid cried, or when the mean pharmacist made his ear
bleed.
MONICA: Alright, I'll give you the ear thing but don't you think the ending was pretty
wonderful? PHOEBE: I didn't watch the ending, I was too depressed. It just kept
getting worse and worse, it should have been called, ""It's a sucky life and just when
you think it can't suck any more it does.""[Scene: Chandler and Joey's apartment. Chandler and Joey are playing Richard at
foosball.]
CHANDLER: Kick save and... denied. RICHARD: But... he gets it back, pass to the middle, lines it up
and... BAM! Yes! Could that shot BE any prettier?
JOEY: Man you are incredible. RICHARD: Well, we had a table in college.
CHANDLER: Oh really, I didn't know they had foosball in the 1800's. RICHARD: Nice moustache by the way. When puberty hits that thing's
really gonna kick in.
MONICA: [enters] Honey. Uh, not to sound too Florence Henderson but, dinner's on the
table.
RICHARD: Ok, just one more point.
MONICA: [grabs the other two bars on Richard's side and scores] Score! Now can we go?
CHANDLER: See, that's why we don't let her play.
RICHARD: Is everything all right?
MONICA: Um-hmm.
RICHARD: Uh-oh.
CHANDLER: Oh hey listen, don't be mad at him, it's our fault. I'm sorry we've been hoggin
so much of his time.
JOEY: Yeah, he's just really great to hang around with.
RICHARD: Well. JOEY: No no, seriously, Chandler and I were just talkin about this.
He is so much cooler than our dads. [Chandler starts kicking him below the table] I mean,
you know, our dad's are ok, ya know, but Richard is just- ow, ow. What are you kickin me
for? Huh? I'm tryin to talk here.
RICHARD: Uh, you guys see me as a dad?
JOEY: Oh yeah.
CHANDLER: No.
JOEY: Nooooo. CHANDLER: Your just, your just clearly not familiar with our young
persons vernacular. See, when we say dad, we mean buddy. We mean pal.
RICHARD: Uh-huh, yeah.
CHANDLER: No no, seriously, Joey's my dad, Monica's my dad. I've even got some dads down
at work.
RICHARD: That's fine. Well, your other dad and I are gonna go have a romantic evening and
I guess I'll just see you kids around.
MONICA: Nighty-nite.
CHANDLER: You're not a dad. You're not a dad.
JOEY: Not a dad.
CHANDLER: I can't believe you got us into trouble. [slaps Joey on the arm. Joey takes
exception and slaps him back]
MONICA: [her and Richard return to her place] So are you ok?
RICHARD: Yeah, just, I feel like I'm about a hundred. I thought I was just one of the
guys.
MONICA: Come here. I'll make you feel like one of the guys. You know for a really cool
guy, you suck at foosball.
RICHARD: What're you talkin' about, I was killin' 'em.
MONICA: Yeah, well they suck too.[Scene: Ross's apartment. Rachel is changing Ben's diaper under Ross's supervision.] ROSS: Ok, and then you take the poopie diaper and you put it in the
poopie diaper pail.
RACHEL: Ok Ross, just so you know, calling it a poopie diaper doesn't make this process
any cuter.
ROSS: [doorbell buzzes] Hello.
CAROL: It's us.
ROSS: Come on up. I'm gonna get the rest of his stuff together. [walks in his room]
RACHEL: Ok, we can do this now, can't we Ben? Yes we can, yes we can. [finishes the
diaper] There. I did it. I did it. Look at that, oh, stays on and everything. Hi.
BEN: Hi.
RACHEL: I'm sorry, what did you just say? Did you just say hi? Oh my God, Ross, Ross, Ben
just said 'Hi'.
ROSS: Wha, what?
RACHEL: Ben just said hi. ROSS: What, the word hi?
RACHEL: Ye-, no, my Uncle Hi.
ROSS: Great, great, and I miss that too, I miss everything.
RACHEL: Oh, I'm sorry, I guess I just bring it out in him.
CAROL and SUSAN: Hello.
RACHEL: Guess what. Ben just said his first word.
CAROL: What did he say?
ROSS: Something about hi.
SUSAN: That's so exciting. CAROL: Mommy is so proud of you. Hi. Hi.

nice hole here. Hey. PHOEBE: [pauses the tape] Ok, Ben, this is the part where Ernie
buries Bert in the sand and can't find him. Now, I've looked ahead on the tape and he does
find him again. But, ok, before that happens, there's some pretty rough goin' for a while
but I think we can handle it. And, there's just the alphabet but we know that ends well

MONICA: 'Cause I was going by it the other day and I saw that there was a stock with my
initials, MEG, on it and, well, sometimes I have to watch for two or three hours before it
comes up again but when it does, it's pretty exciting.

ROSS: Mon, speaking of which, dad says he knows someone you can call for an interview.
MONICA: Really. PHOEBE: Ok, right there. That, that's the third sign today. Right
there.
ROSS: On behalf of everyone, I'd just like to say behuh. PHOEBE: No, 'cause you just said dad and everywhere I go today I
keep getting signs telling me to go see my father. Like when I was walking over here and I
passed a buffet...which is my father's last name.
EVERYONE: Ahh.
PHOEBE: And they were serving franks which is his first name minus the s at the end. And
there was a rotisserie with spinning chicken.
MONICA: His indian name?
PHOEBE: No because I chickened out the last time when I tried to meet him. So I mean
coincidences? I don't think so.
ROSS: Freakish.
MONICA: Wow.
JOEY: Freaky.
MONICA: Weird, weird. RACHEL: Ok, so uh, who wants the last hamburger?

CHANDLER: No actually, I was just going for colorful.
BIG BULLY: What's with this guy?
LITTLE BULLY: What's with you?

up, ya know. Now Chandler...

PHOEBE: Thanks. [gets out of the cab] JOEY: Hey Rach, you uh, you want some sandwich?
RACHEL: Ohh, what is in that?
JOEY: Olive loaf and ham spread, no mayo.
RACHEL: No no, 'cause mayo, that would make it gross.
PHOEBE: [a little dog starts attacking her leg] Hey, hey, no, oh oh.
RACHEL: Run Phoebe run. PHOEBE: No no no, doggie please. Oh, I do so wanna love all animals,
please no.
JOEY: Get him a bone, get a bone. You gotta bone?
RACHEL: Are you kidding me?
PHOEBE: Look kibbles, bits. Oh God, alright, get the hell off my leg you yippity piece of
crap. [Flings the dog off and jumps in the cab. The dog keeps jumping up to the window.]
Ok, alright, we have a problem.
JOEY: Well why don't you just reach out and take his trampoline.
RACHEL: Ok, here, I know what we can do. [grabs Joey's sadwich and throws it out the
window]
JOEY: Hey, hey, hey no. RACHEL: Ok, doggie get the- aahhh. Ok go get the sandwich, get the
sandwich doggie. [dog ignores the sandwich] Good doggie get the sandwich, get the...ok,
Joey, the dog will lick himself but he will not touch your sandwich, what does that say?
JOEY: Well if he's not gonna eat it, I will.
PHOEBE: Are you crazy?
JOEY: Phoebs, he's just a little dog. [turns back to the car window and the dog is halfway
through it.] Ahhh.[Scene: Central Perk. Chandler and Ross are sitting at the couch.]
CHANDLER: Hey.
ROSS: What? CHANDLER: Do you have to be a Century 21 real-estate agent to get to
wear those really cool jackets?
ROSS: Do you say this stuff to girls?
BIG BULLY: Hehehehey, isn't that the guy who used to wear your hat?
LITTLE BULLY: And look where they're sitting.
ROSS: You're joking, right? You guys just walked through the door.
BIG BULLY: Maybe we didn't make it clear enough.
LITTLE BULLY: Yeah. BIG BULLY: This couch belongs to us.
CHANDLER: Alright, I'll tell you what, you call the couch and then, and then we'll call
the couch, and we'll see who it comes to.
BIG BULLY: You know what I keep wondering? Why you two are still sitting here. ROSS: Alright, that's it. I've had enough of this, alright. Gunther,
these guys are trying to take our seat.
GUNTHER: Fellas, these guys were here first.
BIG BULLY: Oh, sorry, I didn't realize.
LITTLE BULLY: Sorry.
GUNTHER: There you go.
ROSS: Thank you Gunther. We didn't want to have to go and do that. LITTLE BULLY: He told on us?
BIG BULLY: You told on us?
ROSS: Well pal, you didn't give me much of a choice. [flicks the ends of the big bully's
tie]
CHANDLER: Don't play with his things.
ROSS: I know. BIG BULLY: Alright, let's take this outside.
ROSS: Let's, let's take this outside? Who talks like that?
BIG BULLY: The guy that's about to kick your ass talks like that.
CHANDLER: You had to ask.
ROSS: Yeah.
[the bullies grab the back of the couch that Ross and Chandler are sitting in and tip
back] ROSS: Ok, ok look, see, the thing is we're, we're not gonna fight
you guys.
LITTLE BULLY: Well then here's the deal, you won't have to so long as never ever show your
faces in this coffee house ever again.
CHANDLER: I think you played the Gunther card too soon.[Scene: Back in the cab in front of Phoebe's dad's house.]
JOEY: Hey Phoeb's, I think you're good to go.
PHOEBE: Yeah, I don't know.
RACHEL: What's the matter?
PHOEBE: I just think that this was a really bad sign, ya know. I mean, like the beast at
the threshold, you know. It's just like, I have no family left, ya know. I mean except for
my grandmother, you know, but let's face it, she's not gonna be around forever, despite
what she says. And I have a sister who I've barely spoken to since we like shared a womb.
I don't know, this is my real father and I just, I want things to be like just right.
RACHEL: Yeah Phoebe, I completely understand.
JOEY: Yeah, whatever you need. Hey, you wanna go home?
PHOEBE: Ok, thanks. Sorry, again
[She starts the cab and pulls forward. We hear a squish and a dog yelp.] PHOEBE: [innocently] What was that?
JOEY: Uhh, I'm guessing the threshold's clear now.[Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. Joey is eating breakfast, Rachel has just gotten
up, and Monica is on the phone.]
MONICA: I wanna buy 5 shares of SGJ and I wanna buy them now. C'mon
time is money my friend. Thank you. Wooo.
RACHEL: Time is money my friend?
JOEY: Yeah, you missed, 'Takes money to make money,' and uh, 'Don't make me come down
there and kick your wall street butt.' MONICA: Hey, I made $17 before breakfast, what have you done?
JOEY: Well uh, I had breakfast here so technically I saved $3.50.
RACHEL: How did you make $17.
MONICA: Well, my financially challenged friends,  I split my money
and I bought some shares of CHP and ZXY.
JOEY: How come those?
MONICA: Well, CHP because I used to have a crush on Eric Estrada. And ZXY becuase I think
it sounds zexy.
RACHEL: What happened to uh, MEG.? MONICA: MEG was good for me but I dumped her. Ya know, my motto is
get out before they go down.
JOEY: That is so not my motto.
PHOEBE: [enters] Hey.
RACHEL: Hey Phoebs. Oh hey, how's the dog?
PHOEBE: Ok, I talked to the vet, people are so nice upstate. Anyway, he said that the
little fella's gonna be ok and I can pick him up tomorrow.
JOEY: Good.
RACHEL: Oh, thank God. PHOEBE: Yeah, but he did have to have a bunch of stitches and he
said that only once in a blue moon does a dog's ear grow back so...still hoping.
RACHEL: Ok, so Phoebe, now are you gonna call your dad and let him know that his dog is
ok?
PHOEBE: I, I don't wanna meet my father over the phone.  What am I
gonna say, like 'Hi, I'm Phoebe, the daughter you abandoned. Oh, by the way, I broke your
dog.'
JOEY: Hey Phoebs, if you want, I'll do it.
PHOEBE: Ok. Listen, just don't say anything about me, ok. [goes over and grabs the phone
that's sitting by Monica] MONICA: DON'T...be too long with the phone.
RACHEL: She'll be a much better friend when the market closes.
JOEY: [dials the phone] It's a woman.
PHOEBE: So talk to her. JOEY: [in a fake voice] Uhh, hello Miss Buffay. I know where your
dog is. I want you to know that he'll be returned to you, almost as good as new, within,
within 24 hours. Uh, goodbye. [hangs up]
RACHEL: Why the voice.
JOEY: [in the voice] Hard to say.[Scene: Chandler and Joey's apartment. Ross is sitting at the bar, Chandler serves up
two mugs of hot water.]
CHANDLER: Your cappucino sir.
ROSS: Thank you.
[they both pour in packets of cappucino mix]
CHANDLER: Ya know I think this is much better than the coffee house.
ROSS: Absolutely.
[they both stir thier coffee and proceed to stare into the mugs] ROSS: How come it's not mixing with the water?
CHANDLER:Well the package says you have to uh, constantly keep it moving. Stir and drink,
stir and drink, never let it settle.
[they both try to drink while continuously stirring]
JOEY: [walks out of his room] Hey, this is ridiculous. I'll tell you what. After I get
back from my neice's christening, I'll go down to the coffee house with you and we'll all
have a nice cup of coffee alright. No problem, Joey's there.
CHANDLER: Ok.
ROSS: No.
CHANDLER: No? ROSS: No. Man I don't wanna have to have Joey with me every time I
wanna descent cup of coffee. Ya know, and I don't wanna spend the rest of my life drinking
cappucino with a 'K'. I say you and I go back down there and stand up to those guys.
CHANDLER: Alright, hang on a second there Custer.
JOEY: Yeah really, Ross, have you ever been beaten up before?
ROSS: Yeah, sure.
JOEY: By someone besides Monica? ROSS: No. So what. So what if we get beaten up, maybe that's just
something every man has to go through once in his life. Ya know, like a, like a right of
passage or somethin'.
CHANDLER: Well, couldn't we just lose our virginities again? Ya know, because I think
actually mine's growing back.[Scene: Outside Monica and Rachel's apartment. Rachel is returning.]
MONICA: [Opens the door] I need to borrow a hundred bucks.
RACHEL: What?
MONICA: Hi, welcome home. [pulls Rachel inside] I need to borrow a hundred bucks.
RACHEL: For what?
MONICA: I've gotta get back in the game.
RACHEL: Why, when did you get out of the game?
MONICA: I don't know, I lost it all ok. I lost it.
RACHEL: Oh no.
MONICA: Hey, I've come to terms with it, you have to too.
RACHEL: Ok. Look uhh, Mon I'm, I'm really sorry.
MONICA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, where are we on the hundred bucks?
RACHEL: I, I don't have it. MONICA: But I need it. Otherwords I'm gonna have to take that
horrible diner job. You know, with the dancing and the costumes. I don't wanna have to
wear flame retardant boobs.
RACHEL: Nobody does honey.[Scene: Phoebe's dad's house. Phoebe is returning the dog who is bandaged up and has a
plastic cone around it's neck.]
PHOEBE: Hi. MRS BUFFAY: Schnoodle. Oh my God, what the hell happened to my dog?
PHOEBE: It was an accident, and, and the woman who did this would never ever hurt a dog on
purpose. She's a vegetarian.
MRS BUFFAY: What are these, stitches?
PHOEBE: Yeah, eight of them. That's 56 to him. You know also, if, if it's raining, you
can't let him look up too long 'cause that cone'll fill up really really fast.
MRS BUFFAY: Yeah well, thanks for bringing back what's left of him.
PHOEBE: Sure, oh, is, is Frank home.
MRS BUFFAY: How do you know Frank?
PHOEBE: Just from a, from a long time ago. Is he here?
MRS BUFFAY: Yeah. Frank.
FRANK: Yeah. What? [a young guy comes around the corner] PHOEBE: Oh, ok, um, I mean Frank senior.
MRS BUFFAY: He went out for groceries.
PHOEBE: Ok so will he be back soon?
MRS BUFFAY: Well he left four years ago so we're expecting him back any minute now.
PHOEBE: Alright, I'm, I'm gonna go. I'm sorry about the dog, everything. I'm sorry.
[she turns to leave, Frank follows]
FRANK: Hey lady. Hey wait up. How do you know my dad?
PHOEBE: Um well I don't really. Just genetically. He's kinda my dad too.
FRANK: Heavy.
PHOEBE: Yeah. So um, did he ever talk about me, Phoebe?
FRANK: No but he didn't really talk about anything.
PHOEBE: Oh.
FRANK: Except stilts.
PHOEBE: Stilts?
FRANK: Yeah, he loved stilts. One time I was upstairs, I was stealing cigarettes out of my
mom's purse, and uh, all of a sudden I look over and there's my dad's head bobbing past
the window. He just had this big smile on his face and he was waving 'cause he was always
happiest when he was on his stilts.
PHOEBE: Wow.
FRANK: Yeah.
PHOEBE: I don't know what to do with that. FRANK: Me neither. So you're like my big sister.
PHOEBE: Yeah.
FRANK: This is huge, you can buy me beer.
PHOEBE: I'm not gonna. But you know what's cool though? Ok, if you had a friend named
Pete, then I could say, 'Oh yeah, I know Pete, he's friends with my brother.'
FRANK: I gotta friend named Mark.
PHOEBE: That'll work too.
FRANK: Cool, alright. So maybe, ya know, I could give you a call sometime, we could talk
or somethin'.
PHOEBE: Yeah, that'd be ok.
FRANK: Alright.
PHOEBE: Ok, I'm in the book.
FRANK: Ok, yeah.
PHOEBE: Alright. So um, stilts huh?
FRANK: Yeah hey, you know if you want I can take you around back and show you where he hit
his head on the rain gutter.
PHOEBE: Ok.[Scene: Central Perk. Chandler and Ross are sitting on the couch nervously.] ROSS: Well we did it, we're here. We are standing our ground. How
long does a cup of coffee take?
CHANDLER: Would you come on! Come on! [waitress brings their coffee] Thank you.
[They rush to put the cream and sugar in their cups and gulp down a few drinks]
CHANDLER: Ah, there we go.
ROSS: I think we proved our point.
CHANDLER: You burn your mouth?
ROSS: Cannot feel my tounge.
[They leave. As they're walking out, the bullies are walking in.] CHANDLER: Bullies, big bullies.
LITTLE BULLY: Oh, look who's here, it's the weenies.
BIG BULLY: Did we not make ourselves clear the other day.
ROSS: Yes, and that's why we're here.
CHANDLER: Yes, we're standing out ground...apparently.
LITTLE BULLY: Let's do this alright.
ROSS: Woah, ho-ho, whad'ya got there, a weapon?
LITTLE BULLY: It's a nice watch, I don't wanna break it on your ribs.
CHANDLER: Alright, let's do this.
LITTLE BULLY: Alright.
[they all put up their fists and prepare to fight]
CHANDLER: Question. If I don't care about my watch, can I use it as a weapon?
ROSS: Whad'ya mean?
CHANDLER: Well, it's sharp, it's metal, I think I can do some, you know, serious damage
with it.
BIG BULLY: No, you can't use your watch.
CHANDLER: Ok. [reaches in his pocket]
BIG BULLY: Or your keys.
CHANDLER: Ok.
LITTLE BULLY: Look, here's what we'll do. We'll put all keys and watches in the hat over
there. Alright. [they all put their keys and watches in the hat and put it on a mail box]
Alright, c'mon man, let's do this.
[they all jump in the street and prepare to fight]
ROSS: Before I forget, are we hitting faces?
BIG BULLY: Of course we're hitting faces, why wouldn't you hit faces?
ROSS: Well because I have to work on Monday, I have a big presentation.
LITTLE BULLY: Actually, you know, uh, I gotta show this apartment tomorrow and uh, you
know, this no faces thing might not be a bad idea.
BIG BULLY: Ok, nothing from the neck up. [everyone gets ready for the fight] Or the waist
down. Dana's ovulating.
LITTLE BULLY: Oh really, you guys tryin' again?
BIG BULLY: Yeah.
CHANDLER: Ok, so let me just get this straight. So we're uh, strictly talking about the
middle? BIG BULLY: C'MON!
ROSS: Hey, hey, woah, you want some of this, huh? You want a piece of this, huh? I'm
standin here, huh.
CHANDLER: Hey, hey, those guys are takin our stuff! [some guy runs off with the hat]
ROSS: Hey.
BIG BULLY: Hey.
[they all run off after the guy][Scene: Central Perk. The four guys are returning after getting the hat back.] ROSS: God, that was, that was amazing, that was incredible. You
guys, you guys kicked butt.
LITTLE BULLY: Us, what about you guys? Man you really, bing, gave it to old Mr. Clean back
there. He was a big guy.
ROSS: Yeah he was wasn't he.
CHANDLER: Yeah, I wouldn't know having missed everything.
BIG BULLY: Don't do that to yourself. Any one of us could have tripped over that little
girls jump-rope.
ROSS: So, listen guys, are we uh, are we ok here?
LITTLE BULLY: We're ok.
ROSS: Alright.
CHANDLER: Ok so, can I have my hat back?
LITTLE BULLY: No.
CHANDLER: Huh. [reaches over and grabs the hat and bolts for the door but slips and falls
behind the couch]CLOSING CREDITS[Scene: The 50's theme cafe. Monica is working the grill, the rest are at a table.] RACHEL: Look at her.
CHANDLER: Hi Monica.
JOEY: He-he-he, how's it goin'?
PHOEBE: Hey nice boobs.
CHANDLER: Guys guys, check this out.
[Chandler puts a coin in the mini jukebox at the table. YMCA starts playing and Monica and
the rest of the staff have to get on the counter and start singing along and dancing.
After a couple of couruses, Chandler pulls out a handful of coins and drops them on the
table.]
JOEY: Excellent.",2,21,TRUE,1183
2,"[Scene: Moondance Diner. Ross, Phoebe, Joey, and Chandler are sitting at
the counter, Monica is working. Monica is wearing her costume, including big fake
breasts.]
MONICA: So, I'll get candles and my mom's lace tablecloth, and since it's Rachel's
birthday, I mean, we want it to be special, I thought I'd poach a salmon.
ALL: Ohhh.
MONICA: What? ROSS: Question. Why do we always have to have parties where you
poach things?
MONICA: You wanna be in charge of the food committee?
ROSS: Question two. Why do we always have to have parties with committees?
JOEY: Really. Why can't we just get some pizzas and get some beers and have fun?
ROSS: Yeah. PHOEBE: Yeah, I agree. Ya know, I think fancy parties are only fun
if you're fancy on the inside and I'm just not sure we are.
MONICA: Alright. If you guys don't want it to be special, fine. You can throw any kind of
party you want.
[Joey is staring at Monica's breasts] MONICA: Joey they're not real. I start miles beneath the surface of
these things, ok, they're fake. See [squeezes her breast] honk honk.
CHANDLER: Wow, it's, it's like porno for clowns.OPENING TITLES[Scene: Central Perk. Chandler, Ross, Joey, Phoebe, and Monica are planning Rache's
birthday party.]
ROSS: I talked to Rachel's sisters, neither of them can come.
MONICA: Ok, um so, I still have to invite Dillon and Emma and Shannon Cooper. JOEY: Woah, woah, woah, uh, no Shannon Cooper.
PHOEBE: Why not her?
JOEY: Cause she uh, she steals stuff.
CHANDLER: Or maybe she doesn't steal stuff and Joey just slept with her and never called
her back.
MONICA: Joey that is horriable. JOEY: Hey I liked her, alright. Maybe, maybe too much. I don't know
I guess I just got scared.
PHOEBE: I'm sorry, I didn't know.
JOEY: I didn't think anyone'd buy that, ok.
[Rachel enters] ROSS: Hi honey, how did it go?
RACHEL: Agh, it was the graduation from hell.
CHANDLER: Ya know, my cousin went to hell on a football scholarship. RACHEL: Ya know, I mean this is supposed to be a joyous occasion. My
sister's graduating from college, nobody thought she would. It's a true testament to what
a girl from long island would do for a Celica.
MONICA: So what happened?
RACHEL: My parents happened. All they had to do was sit in the same stadium, smile
proudly, and not talk about the divorce. But nooo, they got into a huge fight in the
middle of the commencement address. Bishop Tutu actually had to stop and shush them. But
you know what, you know what the good news is? I get to serve coffee for the next 8 hours. PHOEBE: Ok, so I guess we don't invite her parents.
MONICA: Well, how bout just her mom?
CHANDLER: Why her mom?
MONICA: Cause I already invited her.
PHOEBE: Ooh, ooh, did you ask Stacy Roth?
JOEY: Oh no, can't invite her. She also steals.[Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. Chandler, Joey, Monica, and Phoebe are setting
up for the party.]
PHOEBE: Ok, here are the birthday candles. Where's the birthday cake?
MONICA: Ok, we're not having birthday cake, we're having birthday flan.
CHANDLER: Excuse me? MONICA: It's a traditional Mexican custard dessert.
JOEY: Oh that's nice. Happy birthday Rachel, here's some goo.
[knock at the door]
MONICA: [answers the door] Dr. Greene. Oh my God it's Rachel's dad. What're you doing
here?
MR. GREENE: What? The father can't drop by to see the daughter on her birthday?
MONICA: No no, the father can, but um, since I am the roommate I can tell you that she's
not here and I'll pass along the message, ok. So bye-bye.
MR. GREENE: Ohhh, you're having a parteee.
MONICA: No, no, not a party. Just a surprise gathering of some people Rachel knows. Um,
this is Phoebe and Chandler and Joey. MR. GREENE: I'll never remember all of that. So uh, what's the deal?
Rachel comes home, people pop out and yell stuff, is that it?
CHANDLER: This isn't your first surprise party, is it sir?
[knock at the door, Monica answers to see Mrs. Greene]
MRS. GREENE: Hi Monica.
[Monica slams the door back shut] MONICA: Chinese menu guy. Forgot the menus.
CHANDLER: So, basically just a Chinese guy.
JOEY: Uh, hey, Dr. Greene, why don't you come with me, we'll put your jacket on Rachel's
bed.
MR. GREENE: Alright, that sounds like a two person job. [they walk into Rachel's bedroom]
MRS. GREENE: Well, my goodness, what was that?
MONICA: Sandra, I am so sorry, I thought you were Rachel and we just weren't ready for you
yet. MRS. GREENE: You thought I was Rachel?
CHANDLER: Yes because uh, you look so young.
PHOEBE: And because you're both, you know, white women.
MRS. GREENE: Oh, I missed you kids. Well, should I put my coat in the bedroom?
CHANDLER: NO! No, I'll take that for ya.
MRS. GREENE: Oh well thank you. Such a gentleman. Thank you. [Chandler takes the hot pink
coat and grimaces at it] Ahh, it all looks so nice, so festive, all the balloons...
[Chandler, remembering that Joey and Mr. Greene are in the bedroom, throws her coat in a
cupboard] The funniest thing happened to me on the way here. I was...[Joey peeks out]
PHOEBE: [cutting Mrs. Greene off] Ha-ha, that's great, ha-ha. I can't wait to hear the
rest of it, ya know, but I really have to go to the bathroom so... Hey, come with me.
Yeah, yeah, it'll be like we're gal pals, ya know, like at a restraunt. Oh, it'll be fun,
c'mon. [they go in the bathroom]
MONICA: Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God. CHANDLER: Ok, think, what would Jack and Chrissy do?
JOEY: [peeks back out] Ok, now that your coat is safely in the bedr-, [sees that the coast
is clear] oh, ok we can come back out in the living room.
MONICA: So uh, Joey and Chanlder, I, I think it's time that you take Dr. Greene over to
your place.
CHANDLER: Uhh, yes, absdolutely, um. Why again?
MONICA: Because that's where the party is you goon. See this is just the staging area.
JOEY: Right this is staging.
CHANDLER: Yeah, this more than anything else, is the staging area.
JOEY: [as they're walking out, Dr. Greene questioningly gestures at the Happy Birthday
sign over the door] This is clearly in the wrong apartment. [they all walk across the
hall][Scene: Later on in the hallway between the apartments. Chandler is showing people to
the parties.]
CHANDLER: Alright you guys are off to party number one [ushers 3 guys into Monica's
apartment] and you, you are off to party number two [ushers four women into his apartment.
Two guys try to follow and Chandler blocks them and shoos them off to Monica's apartment]
Alright fellas, let's keep it movin', let' keep it movin.
MONICA: Chandler could you at least send some women to my party? [buzzer goes off] Alright
that's Ross.
CHANDLER: Ok, they're coming, shhh. [Runs into Monica's apartment and grabs one last girl
to take to his apartment]
RACHEL: Ohh, thank you for the wonderful dinner.
ROSS: Thanks for being born. RACHEL: Ohh, thank you for my beautiul earrings, they're perfect. I
love you.
ROSS: Oh, now you can exchange them if you want, ok.
RACHEL: Now I love you even more.
[they kiss and Ross backs her into her apartment and turns on the lights]
ALL: Surprise.
RACHEL: Oh my gosh, wow. Monica. Oh my god. Mom. This is so great.
MRS. GREENE: Happy birthday sweetie.
RACHEL: Wow you, you. I had no idea.
ROSS: Really?
RACHEL: No, I knew.
ROSS: All right.
MONICA: Ok, everybody, there's food and drinks on the table. Go across the hall.
ROSS: What?
RACHEL: What?
MONICA: Right now, Joey and Chandler's, go now.
RACHEL: Why.
MONICA: Just go.
[they walk across the hall]
ALL: Surprise.
MR. GREENE: Happy birthday sweetpea.
RACHEL: Daddy.[Ad break. Time lapse. Still at party at Chandler and Joey's. Rachel is talking to
Chandler and Ross.] RACHEL: Both of them are here, both of them, both of them are here?
CHANDLER: Well, we could count again.
RACHEL: I can't believe this is happening. ROSS: You know what, this is ridiculous, ok. This is your birthday,
this is your party. I say we just put 'em all together and if they can't deal with it, who
cares.
RACHEL: I do.
ROSS: That's who.
CHANDLER: Look, are you gonna be ok?
RACHEL: Well, I have to be, I don't really have a choice, I mean, you know, I could look
at the bright side, I get two birthday parties and two birthday cakes.
CHANDLER: Well, actually just one birthday flan.
RACHEL: What?
CHANDLER: It's a traditional Mexican custard dessert...Look talk to Monica, she's on the
food committee.[Time lapse. Chandler runs out of the bathroom.]
CHANDLER: Joey, Joey. Hey, some girl just walked up to me and said, 'I want you Dennis,'
and stuck her tounge down my throat. I love this party.
JOEY: Quick volleyball question.
CHANDLER: Volleyball. JOEY: Yeah, we set up a court in your room. Uh, you didn't really
like that grey lamp, did you?
CHANDLER: Joey, a woman just stuck her tounge down my throat, I'm not even listening to
you.
GIRL'S VOICE: Dennis.
CHANDLER: Ok, that's me. [runs back]
RACHEL: Listen honey, can you keep dad occupied, I'm gonna go talk to mom for a while. ROSS: Ok, do you have any ideas for any openers?
RACHEL: Uhh, let's just stay clear of 'I'm the guy that's doing you daughter' and you
should be ok.[Back in Monica's party]
MONICA: Ok people, I want you to take a piece of paper, here you go, and write down your
most embarassing memory. Oh, and I do ask that when you're not using the markers, you put
the caps back on them because they will dry out.[Back in Chandler and Joey's party] ROSS: Hi Dr. Greene. So, uh, how's everything in the uh, vascular
surgery....game?
MR. GREENE: It's not a game Ross, a woman died on my table today.
ROSS: I'm sorry. See that's the good thing about my job. All the dinosaurs on my table are
already dead.[Back in Monica's party]
MONICA: Listen you guys, I don't mean to be a pain about this but, um, I've noticed that
some of you are just placing them on. You wanna push the caps until you hear them click.
[she demonstrates, Gunther starts to walk to the door] Gunther, where're you going?
GUNTHER: I um, was sorta thinking about maybe...
MONICA: No. No you can't go. No this is fun. Come on we're just getting started. Here,
here's your marker.
PHOEBE: Listen if you wanna go, just go.
GUNTER: No, she'll yell at me again.
PHOEBE: Alright, I can get you out.
GUNTHER: What?
PHOEBE: Shh. In a minute, I'm gonna create a diversion. When I do, walk quickly to the
door and don't look back.[Back at Chandler and Joey's party]
MR. GREENE: I think I need a drink.
ROSS: Oh, here, I, I'll get it for ya. Whad'ya want?
MR. GREENE: Scotch.
ROSS: Scotch. Alright, I'll be back in 10 seconds with your scotch on the rocks in a
glass.
MR. GREENE: Neat.
ROSS: Cool.
MR. GREENE: No no no, no no no, neat, as in no rocks.
ROSS: I know.[Back at Monica's party]
MR. GREENE: Oh hello Ross, where have you been?
ROSS: Hi. Uh, I have been in the bathroom. Stay clear of the salmon mousse.
MRS. GREENE: Oh, scotch neat. Ya know, that's Rachel's father's drink.
ROSS: Oh, mine too. Isn't that neat, scotch neat. Would you excuse me? [walks out in the
hallway, Mr. Greene is walking out of Chandler and Joey's apartment] Hey, hey, where you
uh, sneakin off to mister?
MR. GREENE: I'm getting my cigarettes out of my jacket.
ROSS: No. no.
MR. GREENE: Whad'ya mean no?
ROSS: No, um, see 'cause that, that is, that is the staging area. If you go in there,
it'll ruin the whole illusion of the party. Yeah, I think you take your scotch back in
there and I will get your cigarettes for you sir. MR. GREENE: Get my glasses too.
ROSS: All righty roo. [closes the door] What a great moment to say that for the first
time. [goes to get the cigarettes and glasses]
MONICA: Ok, the first person's most embarassing memory is, 'Monica, your party sucks.'
Very funny. PHOEBE: Oh no, ooh, ooh, did somebody forget to use a coaster?
MONICA: What? [she runs over to where Phoebe is, Phoebe signals for Gunther to go] I don't
see anything.
PHOEBE: Great, I'm seeing water rings again.
MRS. GELLER: Ross, whose glasses are those?
ROSS: Mine.
MRS. GREENE: You wear bi-focals?
ROSS: Um-hmm. [puts them on] I have a condition, apparently, that I require two different
sets of focals.
MRS. GREENE: Did you know my husband has glasses just like that?
RACHEL: Well those are very popular frames.
ROSS: Neil Sedaka wears them.
GUY: [to Phoebe] I hear you can get people out of here.
MRS. GREENE: Rachel, you didn't tell me your boyfriend smoked.
RACHEL: Yeah, like a chimney.
ROSS: Ohh, big smoker. [Packs the cigarettes and flings one on Mrs. Greene in the process.
Finally gets one in his mouth and it look really out of place] Big big smoker. In fact I'm
gonna go ou into the hallway and fire up this bad boy. [as he walks into the hall, he
comes face to face with Mr. Greene] MR. GREENE: Are you wearing my glasses?
ROSS: Yes. [pulls them off and hands them to Mr. Greene] I was just warming up the
earpieces for you.
MR. GREENE: Thank you. Is that one of my cigarettes?
ROSS: [pulls the cigarette off his upper lip and hands it to Mr. Greene] Yeah, yes it is,
I was just moistening the tip.[Back in Monica's party. Phoebe is talking to a guy and two girls at the party.] PHOEBE: Ok, ok, she's taking the trash out so I can get you out of
here but it has to be now, she'll be back any minute.
GIRL 1: What about my friend Victor?
PHOEBE: No, only the three of you, any more than that and she'll get suspicious.
GIRL 1: Alright, let me just get my coat.
PHOEBE: There isn't time. You must leave everything. They'll take care of you next door.
GIRL 1: Is it true they have beer?
PHOEBE: Everything you've heard is true.[Back at Chandler and Joey's party. Everyone is dancing and having fun.]
MONICA: Could you guys please try to keep it down, we're trying to start a Boggle
tournament.
[Chandler and Joey stop dancing and laugh at her]
MONICA: You, and you, you're supposed to be at my party. And Gunther! What are you doing
here?
GUNTHER: Um [gestures to dance floor]
PHOEBE: [enters with the three people she got out] Ok, welcome to the fu-oh.
MONICA: Phoebe.
PHOEBE: Alright, I'm sorry but these people needed me. They work hard all week, it's
Saturday night, they deserve to have a little fun. Go.
MONICA: Ya know, my party is fun. I mean, maybe it's a little quieter, less obvious sorta
fun but, you know, if people would just give it a chance... [volleyball hits her in the
head from behind][Back at Monica's party]
RACHEL: You want me to see a therapist?
MRS. GREENE: Sweetheart, you obviously have a problem. You've chosen a boyfriend exactly
like your father.
RACHEL: Ok mom, you know what, fine, I'll make an appointment ok, but you know what, right
now, I gotta go, I gotta go do a thing.[Chandler and Joey's party]
MR. GREENE: Did you know your mother spent $1200 dollars on bansai trees. I felt like
Gulliver around that place.
RACHEL: Daddy, daddy, you know what, I really wanna hear more about this, I really do, but
I just have, I just have to do a, some stuff.
[Monica's party]
MRS. GREENE: You work and you work and you work at a marriage but all he cares about is
his stupid boat.
[Chandler and Joey's party]
MR. GREENE: You work and you work and you work on a boat...
MRS. GREENE: He always ridiculed my pottery classs...
MR. GREENE: ...and you sand it and you varnish it...
MRS. GREENE: ...but when all is said and done, he still drinks out of the mugs.
MR. GREENE: ...and her yoga and her Bridges of Madison County...
MRS. GREENE: ...the scotch and the cigarettes...
MR. GREENE: ...and the bansai's and the chiuaua...
MRS. GREENE: ...I may have only been in therapy for three weeks now dear but...
MR. GREENE: ...what the hell does she want with half a boat...[Scene: The hallway after the party. Rachel is sitting there.]
CHANDLER: [running out of his apartment after a girl] Ok, ok, you can be shirts and I'll
be skins. I'll be skins. [sits down beside Rachel] Hey, how you holdin' up there, tiger?
Oh, sorry, when my parents were getting divorced I got a lot of tigers. Got a lot of
champs, chiefs, sports, I even got a governor. RACHEL: This is it, isn't it? I mean, this is what my life is gonna
be like. My mom there, my dad there. Thanksgiving, Christmas. She gets the house, he's in
some condo my sister's gonna decorate with wicker. Oh, Chandler how did you get through
this?
CHANDLER: Well, I relied on a carefully regimented program of denial and, and wetting the
bed. RACHEL: Ya know, I just, so weird. I mean I was in there just
listening to them bitch about each other and all I kept thinking about was the fourth of
July.
CHANDLER: Becasue it reminded you of the way our forefathers used to bitch at each other?
RACHEL: It's just this thing. Every year we would go out on my dad's boat and watch the
fireworks. Mom always hated it because the ocean air made her hair all big. My sister Jill
would be throwing up over the side and my dad would be upset becasue nobody was helping
and then when we did help he would scream at us for doing it wrong. But then when the
fireworks started, everybody just shut up, you know, and it'd get really cold, and we
would all just sort of smush under this one blanket. It never occured to anybody to bring
another one. And now it's just...
CHANDLER: I, I know. [Hugs her. Ross walks out and Chandler puts her in his arms.][Scene: Monica's party. She is seeing off the last of the guests.]
MONICA: Ok, thanks for coming, I hope you guys had fun.
MRS. GREENE: Alright, Monica dear, I'm gonna hit the road. Now I've left my 10 verbs on
the table. And you be sure and send me that finished poem.
MONICA: Ok will do. So glad you came.
MRS. GREENE: I think I saw Rachel out in the hall.
MONICA: Ok, let me go check. Your mom want's to say goodbye.
RACHEL: Oh ok.
MRS. GREENE: Happy birthday sweetie.
RACHEL: Ok.
[Mr. Greene opens the door to Chandler and Joeys apartment. Ross sees him and runs to the
door forcing him back in then holds onto the door knob.]
JOEY: Ahh, you drive safe.
MRS. GREENE: Ross, what're you doing.
ROSS: I'm getting ready for the water skiing. [Mr. Greene opens the door which pulls Ross
in] How are you doing?
CHANDLER: Well, uh, Dr. Greene, where are you going?
MR. GREENE: To get my coat.
GUYS: No no no.
MR. GREENE:Alright, alright, I can get my own coat.
[the guys form a wall between Mrs Geller and Mr Geller and dance across the hall as he
walks across] CHANDLER: Sorry, we're on a major flan high.
PHOEBE: Oh no, you're not supposed to be here. This is the staging area, you should, it's
all wrong, you should leave, ya know, get out. [opens the door, the guys are right there]
Or perhaps you'd like a creme d'menthe.
MR. GREENE: I have to be heading to my chateau, thank you.
PHOEBE: Oh all right, then I guess we're going back into the hallway.
JOEY: Thanks for coming Mrs. Greene. [grabs her and kisses her to distract her. She goes
limp in his arms. Mr. Greene leaves.] Well, ok, you take care.
MRS. GREENE: Oh, you kids [she caresses his face and chest] Well, this is the best party
I've been to in years.
MONICA: Thank you.CLOSING CREDITS[Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. Close up of the flan on the table with birthday
candles.] MONICA: Ok everybody, it's time for flan.
CHANDLER: Yup, get ready for the gelatenous fun.
JOEY: Kinda looks like that stuff you get when you get a bad infection.
MONICA: Ok, that's enough. PHOEBE: Ok Rachel, make a special flan wish.
RACHEL: Ok, I've got one. [blows out the candles. Somebody calls out 'heads up' and the
volleyball lands in the flan] Wow, those things almost never come true.",2,22,TRUE,1184
2,"[Scene: Central Perk. Rachel, Monica, Joey, and Chandler are there.]
[Rachel brings a muffin to Chandler and Monica who are sitting on the couch.] RACHEL: Ok, Chandler, Mon, there's only one bananna nut muffin left.
[Rachel holds the tray between them. Chandler grabs the muffin before Monica can.]
MONICA: Oh, I ordered mine first.
CHANDLER: Yeah, but I'm, I'm so much faster...
MONICA: Give it to me.
CHANDLER: No.
MONICA: Give it to me.
CHANDLER: Ok, you can have it. [He licks it and offers it to her.] MONICA: [She grabs the coffee cup on the table and licks the rim.]
There you go, enjoy your coffee.
CHANDLER: That was there when I got here. [Takes a bite of his muffin.]
PHOEBE: [enters] Hey you guys, you will never guess who's coming to New York.
MONICA: [Chandler tries to come back with a smart-ass remark but can't swallow the
muffin.] Quick, Phoebe, tell us before he can swallow.
PHOEBE: Oh ok, Ryan, that guy I went out with, who's in the Navy.
[Chandler is visibly upset]
RACHEL: You went out with a guy in the Navy?
PHOEBE: Yeah, I met him when I was playing guitar in Washington Square Park. Ryan threw in
salt water taffy 'cause he didn't have any change.
JOEY: Hey, is that when you wrote salt water taffy man?
PHOEBE: No. No, he is my submaring guy. He resurfaces like every couple years and we have
the most amazing three days together. Only this time he's coming for two weeks. Two whole
weeks, which means yay. RACHEL: So wait, this guy goes down for like two years at a time?
[Once again, Chandler has a bite in his mouth and can't come back.]
MONICA: That'll teach you to lick my muffin.
ROSS: [enters] Hiii.
JOEY: Oh no, what happened?
ROSS: Well, I just spoke to Carol. Ben's got the chicken pox.
ALL: Oh no.
ROSS: Yeah, so if you haven't already had it, chances are you're gonna get it.
RACHEL: Well I've had it.
JOEY: Yeah, I've had it.
MONICA: Had it.
CHANDLER: Had it.
PHOEBE: Well, I've never had it, I feel so left out. [Sees a red bump on her arm.] Oh
look!OPENING TITLES[Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. Monica and Richard are in her bedroom.] MONICA: Honey, you made the bed again. I told you, you don't have to
do that. This isn't camp.
RICHARD: Ooh, then I guess the panty raid last night was totally uncalled for. Ok, I am
going to take a shower and today I will be singing Jim Crochee's Leroy Brown.
[He walks out of the bedroom and Monica starts to remake the bed.]
RICHARD: Monica... [He re-enters the bedroom and Monica jumps on the bed, trying to cover
it.] Hey Mon, I have a question. Is Leroy the baddest man in the whole damn town or the
fattest man in the whole damn town?
MONICA: Baddest. Otherwise the song would be Fat Fat Leroy Brown.
RICHARD: What're you doing?
MONICA: Just waiting for you sweetie.
RICHARD: Are you remaking the bed?
MONICA: I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You know what, the way you did it was just fine.
RICHARD: Then, you're redoing it because... MONICA: If I tell you, you'll think I'm crazy.
RICHARD: You're pretty much running that risk either way.
MONICA: Ok, you see, the tag shouldn't be at the top left corner, it should be at the
bottom right corner. RICHARD: Oh, well that's not so crazy.
MONICA: I'm just easing you in.
RICHARD: Oh, alright.
MONICA: Alright, you see these little flower blossoms? They should be facing up, not down,
because, well, the head of the bed is where the sun would be. You don't love me any more
do you.
RICHARD: Actually, if it's possible, I love you more. MONICA: Really? Wow, well then come on, I wanna show you how to fold
the toilet paper into a point.[Scene: Chandler's office. Joey is there.]
CHANDLER: Hey, look Joey, I'm just saying if you need something to hold you over, I can
get you a job right here as an entry level processor.
JOEY: But don't you need experience for a job like that?
CHANDLER: It's not that hard to learn. And as for people realizing you have no idea what
you're doing, hey, you're an actor. Act like a processor, people will think you're a
processor.
SCOTT: [enters] Hey Chandler, here's this morning's projections.
CHANDLER: Hey thanks. Scott Alexander, Joey Tribbianni. Joey is a uh, fellow processor.
SCOTT: No kidding. JOEY: Oh yeah yeah. I process. People want the processing, I'm the
one they call.
SCOTT: Where do you work?
JOEY: Uhh, well, right now I'm in between things. You know how it is. One day you're
processing, the next day you're not so much... processing any more.
CHANDLER: I was just telling Joey about the opening in Fleischman's group.
SCOTT: Fleischman's group. Whatever you do, don't touch his sandwiches. Ha-ha-ha...
JOEY: Ha-ha. [Scott leaves] Are all you processors dorks?[Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. Monica and Rachel are doing Phoebe's makeup.]
RACHEL: Oh, this lipstick looks just great on you.
MONICA: You look fabulous honey, you really do.
PHOEBE: Yeah? Are you sure, really. [She picks up a mirror and sees the white splotches
all over her face.] RACHEL: You see, you look beautiful. For god sakes, dim the lights.
PHOEBE: I, I, I'm hideous. MONICA: It's gonna be ok. Ryan's been under water. He's just gonna
be so glad that you don't have barnicles on your butt.[Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. Ryan is walks up to the door and knocks.]
PHOEBE: Come in.
RYAN: Hey baby, I'm back... [Phoebe is sitting by the window in a veil.]
PHOEBE: Hey Ryan, what's up?
RYAN: What's goin' on? PHOEBE: Well, no no, you have to stay back. I, I have the pox.
RYAN: Chicken or small?
PHOEBE: Chicken. Which is so ironic considering I'm a vegetarian.
RYAN: Why aren't you at home in bed?
PHOEBE: 'Cause my, my grandmother's never had chicken pox. Please, please tell me you
have, 'cause oh my God, I forgot how cute you are.
RYAN: I'm sorry, I never had 'em.
PHOEBE: Ohh, ohh. RYAN: If I had one wish, it would be to build a time machine, go
back to when I was 7, when Jimmy Hauser had the chicken pox. I would grab that kid and rub
him all over my face.
PHOEBE: Yeah, or you know, you could just wish that I didn't have them now.
RYAN: Can I please see your face?
PHOEBE: Nope. You don't want to see a face covered with pox.
RYAN: Your face could be covered with lochs, I wouldn't care.
PHOEBE: And you hate fish. Oh. That's so sweet, alright. Ok, alright, you can see. This is
me... [she unveils herself right as a huge lightning bolt crashes outside. Ryan screams in
terror.] Oh, I am scary.
RYAN: Sorry, the lightning. Lightning was an unfortunate incidence. You look lovely,
lovely. PHOEBE: I hate this. 'Cause I tell you, I had the most amazing two
weeks planned for us, and almost everything I had in mind, we had to be a lot closer than
this.
RYAN: Phoebe, I have spent the last eight months in a steel tube with men, thinking about
this moment. I am not gonna let a bunch of itchy spots stand between us. [He walks to her
and kisses her.]
PHOEBE: Ok, this is the most romantic disease I've ever had.[Scene: Chandler's office. Joey enters.]
JOEY: Hey.
CHANDLER: Hey, how's the first day goin'?
JOEY: Pretty good. It's like you said. It's mostly just putting numbers from one column
into another column.
CHANDLER: Well there you go.
JOEY: Hey and everbody is so nice. I just had a good talk with that lady with the red
hair, Jeannie.
CHANDLER: Jeannie, the head of east coast operations Jeannie? JOEY: Yeah, turns out our kids go to the same school. Small world
huh?
CHANDLER: Weird world. Your kids? JOEY: I figure my character has kids.
CHANDLER: Ya know there isn't a part of that sentence I don't need explained. JOEY: Well, see when you're acting you need to think about stuff
like that. My character, Joseph the processor guy, has two little girls, Ashley and
Brittany. Ashley copies everything Brittany does.
CHANDLER: Well, invisible kids can be that way sometimes. JOEY: Yeah. Joseph and his wife, Karen, are thinking of having a
third kid... Ya know what? Just did.
CHANDLER: Really? Wow. That's some pretty powerful imaginary sperm you must have there.[Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. Phoebe and Ryan are playing Monopoly.]
RYAN: You know what makes the itching even worse?
PHOEBE: That you don't stop talking about it.
RYAN: Fine.
PHOEBE: Let's just play, ok. Good, ok. [She picks up the dice.] Here we go, double sixes,
here we go... [She starts to rub the dice all over herself.] Here we go, come to mama,
just getting ready to roll the dice...
RYAN: What're you doing? Are you scratching?
PHOEBE: No. This is what I do for luck, ok.
RYAN: You're scratching. Give me the dice.
PHOEBE: No.
RYAN: Give me the dice.
PHOEBE: No. Here. [Throws them on the table.] There. Ooh, double sixes.
RYAN: We can't scratch. You know we can't, we'll scar.
PHOEBE: Uhh, I can't stop thinking about it. It's just so hard. I just wanna grab all
these houses and rub 'em all over my body. [Grabs a handful of the houses.]
RYAN: No.
PHOEBE: Give it.
RYAN: No.
PHOEBE: Yeah, come on. You know you want it, you know you want it too, come on. Let's just
be bad, it'll feel so good. [She starts scratching him.]
RYAN: Oh God help me.
PHOEBE: Now do me, do my back. Oh come on, harder.
[They get back to back and start rubbing against each other. Ross and Rachel enter.]
RACHEL: Oh, stop that, stop that right now.
ROSS: You know, I might have expected this of you Phoebe, but Ryan, you're a military man.[Scene: Chandler's office building. Joey and Jeannie are talking.]
JOEY: You and Milton have to join us on the boat. Karen'll pack a lunch, you'll bring the
kids, we'll make a day of it.
JEANNIE: Oh, that sounds lovely. We're gonna have to set that up. Oh, I better get back.
Hope the baby feels better.
JOEY: Oh, thanks, thanks. Bye bye Jeannie. JEANNIE: Bye bye Joey.
JOEY: What a phony.
CHANDLER: Well, I'm sure you'll teach her a lesson when she steps off the dock onto
nothing. Hey Mr. Douglas.
JOEY: Sir.
MR. DOUGLAS: Uh, listen Bing, I received your memo. So, we're not gonna receive the
systems report until next Friday?
CHANDLER: Well the people in my group wanna spend the holiday weekend with their families.
MR. DOUGLAS: I have a family, I'm gonna be here.
JOEY: Yeah Bing, what's that about?
CHANDLER: It's about cutting my people a little slack, ya know, for morale. Look, if you
wanna see some rough numbers, I can get them to you by Wednesday.
MR. DOUGLAS: Rough numbers?
JOEY: This company was not built on rough numbers. Am I right Mr. Douglas.
MR. DOUGLAS: Have the final numbers on my desk by Tuesday.
CHANDLER: Uh, if you say so sir.
JOEY: Joseph's good, isn't he?
CHANDLER: Well, I'm going to kill you.
JOEY: Hey, hey, I just figure Joseph's the kinda guy that likes to mix it up. Ya know, get
in there, ruffle some feathers.
CHANDLER: Why?
JOEY: Look, I'm sorry but that's what Joseph does, ok. If you try to pull somethin', he'll
call you on it. 'What're you tryin' to pull,' he'll say.[Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. Monica enters her bedroom with a roll of duct
tape. Richard is sitting on the bed.]
RICHARD: Ooh, duct tape. Was I supposed to bring something too?
MONICA: This is for the scratchy twins out there. I taped oven mits to their hands.
RICHARD: You're strict.
MONICA: It's for their own good. RICHARD: You know, I like the way you have efficiently folded this
tab under. See in a tape emergency you could shave valuable seconds off your time. MONICA: Exactly. Oh, I love that I can be totally neurotic around
you now. Tell me the truth. Don't you like it better now that
everything on your desk is perpendicular?
RICHARD: If it's not a right angle, it is a wrong angle.
MONICA: Very good.
RICHARD: Thank you.
MONICA: You know what. Tomorrow I'm gonna do your clocks.
RICHARD: You're gonna do what to my clocks.
MONICA: I'm gonna set them to my time.
RICHARD: Well, I'm confused. I thought we shared time. MONICA: No no. See, in my bedroom I set my clock six minutes fast.
You wanna know why?
RICHARD: Because it's in a slightly different time zone than the kitchen.
MONICA: No forget it, I'm not gonna tell you now.
RICHARD: No come on. Come on tell me.
MONICA: No. See you don't understand.
RICHARD: Come on.
MONICA: No. You don't have any of these cute little obsessive things.
RICHARD: No that's not true. That is not true.
MONICA: Oh yeah.
RICHARD: Yeah.
MONICA: Alright, well tell me one of yours.
RICHARD: Ok. Ahh. One of my things is, I always separate my sweat socks from my dress
socks.
MONICA: What if they get mixed up?
RICHARD: Boy I would just uh, I would freak out. MONICA: You would not. I can't believe this. I hate this, you're too
normal. I can't believe my boyfriend doesn't have a thing. My boyfriend doesn't have a
thing.
RICHARD: See, if anyone overheard that, I didn't come off well.[Scene: Chandler's office. Chandler is asleep in his chair holding a paper in one hand
and a pen in the other. Joey walks in, waking up Chandler who covers by pretending to
write on the paper.]
JOEY: Hey. Mr. Douglas is looking for you.
CHANDLER: Why? Wh- wh- why is Mr. Douglas looking for me?
JOEY: 'Cause he has a strong suspicion that you dropped the ball on the Lender project.
CHANDLER: Wha- wh- why, why, why does he suspect that?
JOEY: Becasue at first he thought it was Joseph. But after he asked Joseph about it, turns
out it was you. Anyway, I just thought you should know.
CHANDLER: Alright, that's it. Look Joey, I'm sorry, I realize this is the role of a
lifetime for ya, and if I could just fire Joseph, I would, but unfortunately that's not
possible so I'm gonna have to let both of you go.
JOEY: What're you talking about, everybody loves Joseph.
CHANDLER: I don't, I hate Joseph, ok. I think he's a brown-nosing suck up.
JOEY: Oh yeah. Well you can't fire Joseph. You know why, 'cause he's not in your
department.
CHANDLER: Alright, ok, alright. So I can't fire Joseph but uh, I can sleep with his wife.
JOEY: Karen. CHANDLER: Yeah, Karen. I'm thinking about having an affair with her.
Oh, you know what? I just did.
JOEY: Ahh. What the hell are you doing to me man. CHANDLER: Oh well it's not me, it's my character, Chandy. Yeah the
rogue processor who seduces his co-worker's wives for sport and then laughs about it the
next day at the water cooler. In fact, I have her panties right there in my drawer.
JOEY: Really?
CHANDLER: No freakshow, she's fictional.
JOEY: Take it easy. If it means that much to you, I'll uh, I'll go find something else.
CHANDLER: Thank you.
JOEY: It's just that, I, I'm gonna miss Joseph. I liked him. His wife, she was hot.
[Chadler pushes him out the door by the face.][Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. Rachel and Ross are in the kitchen. Phoebe is
sitting at the couch with oven mits on her hands.]
PHOEBE: Can I please take these off? I swear I won't scratch.
RACHEL: No sorry hon, Monica's orders.
RYAN: [Comes out of the bathroom, also with oven mits on his hands.] Well that wasn't
easy.
ROSS: Ok, dinner's on.
RACHEL: And there's a peach cobbler warming in the oven so the plate's gonna be hot but
that shouldn't be a problem for you.
ROSS: Alright you kids, bye now.
PHOEBE and RYAN: Bye. [waving] ROSS: Oh look, a low budget puppet show.
PHOEBE: It's such a shame you can't see which finger I'm holding up.
[Ross and Rachel leave.]
RYAN: Wine?
PHOEBE: Please. [Ryan pulls the cork with his teeth and spits it into Phoebe's mits.]
RYAN: Oh, I spilled some.
PHOEBE: I got it. [Wipes it up with her mits.]
RYAN: [Puts his hands over Phoebe's ears.] I must tell you, you look beautiful tonight.
PHOEBE: What?
RYAN: Sorry. You look beautiful.
PHOEBE: Oh.
[They start to kiss. They try to get each other's shirts off but can't get the buttons
undone.]
PHOEBE: You know what, that's it, that's it. [She rips off the mits, Ryan follows her
lead.]
[They keep kissing and start scratching each other. Ross enters, takes one look, and goes
right back out the door.][Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. Richard and Monica are in bed.]
RICHARD: Monica, wake up. Monica.
MONICA: What's up?
RICHARD: I thought of a thing.
MONICA: Yeah?
RICHARD: Yeah. I have to sleep, have to, on this side of the bed.
MONICA: No honey. You have to sleep on this side of the bed because I have to sleep on
this side of the bed.
RICHARD: Or so I would have you believe.
MONICA: No. Big deal, so you have a side of the bed, everybody has a side of the bed.
RICHARD: Hey come on, you haven't heard my reason yet.
MONICA: Alright, go on.
RICHARD: Ok, I have to sleep on the west side because I grew up in California and
otherwise the ocean would be on the wrong side.
MONICA: Oh my God, you're a freak.
RICHARD: Yeah. How 'bout that.[Scene: Central Perk. Phoebe, Rachel, Ross, and Ryan are there. Ryan is in uniform,
getting ready to leave.] RACHEL: So uh, Ryan, were you shipping off to?
RYAN: I really can't say.
ROSS: So do you have like any nuclear weapons on board?

JOEY: Incredible! I met the director this time and you'll never believe who it was.
ALL: Who?
JOEY: All right. I'll give you one hint. Warren Beatty.
ALL: Wow!
JOEY: Yeah, there's just one thing that might be kind've a problem. See, I, uh, had to
kiss this guy.
CHANDLER: 'Cause he was just so darn cute.
JOEY: No, as part of the audition. See, I'm up for this part of this guy, who the main guy
kisses.
ROSS: Well, hey. You're an actor, I say you just suck it up and do it. (Rachel looks at
him in disbelief) Or you just do it.
JOEY: I did do it, I'm a professional.
MONICA: Then what's the problem?
JOEY: See after the scene, Mr. Beatty comes up to me and says 'good actor, bad kisser'.
Can you believe that, me not a good kisser, that's like, like Mother Theresa, not a good
mother. 
PHOEBE: Well, come on, who cares what that guy thinks. What does Warren Beatty know about
kissing (Chandler and Monica, give her a look that says 'think about it') Ooh.
OPENING CREDITS
[Scene: continued from earlier]
CHANDLER: Hey, what did your agent say?
JOEY: Yep, this kiss thing is defiantly a problem, Mr. Beatty wants to see it again on
Monday. Man, I gotta figure out what I'm doing wrong. Oh, okay, one of you girls come over
here and kiss me.
MONICA: What, forget it!
RACHEL: Yeah, right.
JOEY: Come on, I need your help here.
PHOEBE: All right. I'll do it, I kissed him before I can do it again.
JOEY: You see this, this is a friend.
PHOEBE: Uh-huh, let's go. (they move in to kiss) Oh, wait I have gum. Okay. (they kiss
rather passionately) Good, very good, firm but tender. I'd recommend you to a friend.
JOEY: Then I don't know what it is. What's the problem?
MONICA: Joey, you know, maybe your just not used to kissing men, maybe you just tensed up
a little, maybe that's what you need to work on.
JOEY: Yeah, that makes sense. (looks at Ross)
ROSS: Over my dead body! (Joey looks at Chandler)
CHANDLER: And I'll be using his dead body as a shield.
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Phoebe, Monica, and Richard are there]
ROSS: (entering from Rachel's bedroom) Come on out, honey! I'm telling you look good!
(turns around, and under his breath, to the rest of the guys) Tell her she looks good,
tell her she looks good.

guy I was thinking maybe you could bring him.....Hello? Hello? (picks up a statue of an
Indian and walks into 
his room)
(the computer bing, bongs)
PHOEBE: Aren't you gonna answer her, that's like the tenth bing-bong message she sent. She
wants to know what's wrong?
CHANDLER: What's wrong? What's wrong? You're married that's what's wrong.
(bing, bong)
PHOEBE: Oh, my.
CHANDLER: What?
PHOEBE: She wants to meet you in person.
CHANDLER: Hey, look, Phoebe I wanted to meet her in person too, okay, but she's married,
she has a husband.
PHOEBE: What if the husband person is the wrong guy, and you are the right guy. I mean you
don't get chances like this all the time, if you don't meet her now, you're gonna be
kicking yourself when your 80, which is hard to do, and that's how you break a hip.
CHANDLER: Okay, I'll do it!
PHOEBE: Oh, yeah! Okay! Great! Go, man, go put on your shoes, and, and march out there and
meet her! (Chandler runs and picks up his shoes) Oh, wait, no, no you have to take a
shower, 'cause, eww. (Chandler runs to the bathroom, as the computer bing-bongs) No, you
know what you have to answer her, answer her first. (Chandler runs to the computer) No,
no, you know what make some coffee 'cause its too much. (Chandler walks slowly into the
kitchen)

RICHARD: Okay, last chance. (Monica throws the candy and hits some woman in the back of
the head, Richard turns around and says) Again, I'm sorry.
MONICA: You know what, maybe I don't need to have children. You know maybe I just think I
do because that is what society, and by that I mean my mom, has always convinced me that
I...(sees two little girls dancing together) I do, I have to have children, I'm sorry, I
just do.
BEST MAN: (standing up) Yo! Can I have your attention, please, Best Man, making a toast
here. Thank you. (clears throat, and starts reading his toast) I remember when Barry got
home from his first date with Rachel...
ALL: What?!
BEST MAN: What, (to Barry) you hired the same band I can't use the same speech. (gets a
'da-doom-chesh' from the drummer) Thank you, thank you very much. Anyway, I wish you both
a wonderful life together. And Rachel...
RACHEL: What.
BEST MAN: No, no, no now in all seriousness, its not a lot of women would've had the guts
to come back here tonight, and even fewer, who would do it with their asses hanging out!
(da-doom-chesh)
ROSS: (standing up) Uh, I like to, uh, to add something to that...
RACHEL: Why are you adding, why are you adding, why are you adding, why are you adding?
ROSS: Most of you don't know me, I'm Rachel's boyfriend.
RACHEL: Oh dear God.
ROSS: Ross, uh and uh, I'd just like to say that it did take a lot of courage for Rachel
to come here tonight. And, uh, for the record she did not run out on Barry because she had
syphilis. (da-doom-chesh) (to drummer) What are you doing I'm serious. Uh, the reason she
walked out on, on Barry is simply that she didn't love him, which incidentally worked out
pretty well for me (looks for the da-doom-chesh, and doesn't get one) Cheers.
RACHEL: (to Ross) She you in the parking lot.
ROSS: (runs after her) No, Rach!
BARRY: And once again she is out of here. Okay who had 9:45? Um?
RACHEL: (after a pause with everyone staring at her, she goes up to the microphone) Ya,
know what Barr, I'm not gonna leave. I probably should, but I'm not, see 'cause I promised
myself that I would make it through at least *one* of your weddings (da-doom-chesh). See
now, tonight, all I 
really wanted was to make it though this evening with a little bit of grace and dignity.
Well (laughing), I guess we can all agree that's not gonna happen. There's nothing really
left to say except....(starts singing) ""Her name was Lola. She was a showgirl. With
yellow feathers (band joins in), feathers in her hair, and a dress cut down to there. She
would...""
ROSS: Marenge,
RACHEL: (singing) ""...marenge, thank you honey, and do the cha-cha. And while she
like to be a star, Tony always tended bar. At the, wait, wait, everybody..""
ROSS: Everybody!

the Copa, Coo-pa Ca-ban-a, music and fashion were always the passion, at the Copa....

RICHARD: If I have to I'll, I'll do all again , I'll do the 4 o'clock feeding thing, I'll
go to the P.T.A. meetings, I'll coach the soccer team.
MONICA: Really?
RICHARD: Yeah, if I have to. Monica, I don't wanna lose you, so if I have to do it all
over again, then I will.
MONICA: You're the most wonderful man. And if you hadn't of said 'if I have to' like
seventeen times, then I'd be saying 'okay, let's do it.'
RICHARD: But you're not.
MONICA: Oh my God, I can't believe what I'm getting ready to say. I wanna have a baby, but
I don't wanna have one with someone who doesn't really wanna have one.
RICHARD: God. I love you.
MONICA: I know you do. Me too. (pause) So what now?
RICHARD: I guess we just keep dancing.
